                                <li>Founded Buddhism after achieving enlightenment under the Bodhi tree, developing the
                                    Four Noble Truths about suffering and its cessation.
                                    His teachings spread across Asia, becoming one of the world's major religions with
                                    over 500 million followers today.</li>
                                <li>Born a prince in Lumbini (modern Nepal), he renounced royal life to seek spiritual
                                    truth after witnessing human suffering.
                                    His journey of asceticism and meditation led to his enlightenment at age 35</li>
                                <li>Established the Middle Way philosophy, rejecting both extreme asceticism and
                                    material indulgence.
                                    His Eightfold Path became Buddhism's core framework for ethical living and mental
                                    discipline.</li>
                                <li>Founded the Sangha (monastic community), creating one of history's oldest continuous
                                    monastic traditions.
                                    His disciples memorized and transmitted his teachings orally for centuries before
                                    they were written down.

                                </li>
                                <li>Taught concepts like karma, rebirth, and nirvana that shaped spiritual thought
                                    across Asia.
                                    His emphasis on mindfulness and compassion remains influential in modern psychology
                                    and wellness practices.</li>
                                <li>Died at age 80 in Kushinagar, attaining parinirvana (final nirvana), with his relics
                                    enshrined across the Buddhist world.
                                    His life story and teachings continue to inspire meditation practices and
                                    philosophical inquiry worldwide.</li>

                                <li>Developed Confucianism, a system of ethical philosophy that shaped Chinese
                                    civilization for over 2,000 years.
                                    His teachings emphasized moral character, social harmony, and proper conduct in
                                    relationships.</li>
                                <li>Served as an official in Lu state before spending years traveling and teaching his
                                    disciples.
                                    Compiled and edited classical Chinese texts including the Five Classics that became
                                    Confucian canon.</li>
                                <li>Established the Golden Rule principle: "Do not do to others what you do not want
                                    done to yourself."
                                    His philosophy stressed filial piety, ritual propriety, and the moral example of
                                    rulers.</li>
                                <li>Created the educational concept of "cultivating the self" before governing others.
                                    His teachings formed the basis of China's imperial examination system for over a
                                    millennium.</li>
                                <li>Believed society should be organized around five key relationships with mutual
                                    responsibilities.
                                    His ideas about meritocracy influenced government systems throughout East Asia.</li>
                                <li>Died at 72, his teachings later becoming China's state philosophy during the Han
                                    Dynasty.
                                    Confucian values continue to influence East Asian cultures, business practices, and
                                    social norms today.</li>
