                                Born in Corsica in 1769, Napoleon quickly advanced through military ranks during the
                                French Revolution. By 1799, he seized power in a coup, declaring himself First
                                Consul.
                                In 1804, he crowned himself Emperor, consolidating absolute authority..

                            <h4>The Height of Empire</h4>

                            <p>
                                Napoleonâ€™s military genius expanded French dominance across Europe. Victories at
                                Austerlitz and Jena made him feared, while legal reforms like the Napoleonic Code
                                modernized governance. However, constant wars drained France and provoked
                                resistance.
                            </p>
                            <h4>The Downfall</h4>
                            <p>
                                The disastrous 1812 invasion of Russia marked the beginning of the end. Defeated by
                                a
                                coalition of European powers, Napoleon was forced to abdicate in 1814 and was exiled
                                to
                                Elba. He escaped in 1815, briefly reclaiming power during the "Hundred Days," but
                                his
                                final defeat at Waterloo sealed his fate.</p>
                            <h4>Final Exile</h4>
                            <p>
                                The British exiled Napoleon to the remote island of Saint Helena in the South
                                Atlantic.
                                There, he lived in isolation until his death in 1821. Despite his fall, Napoleonâ€™s
                                legacy endures in law, military strategy, and the reshaping of Europe.</p>

                            <p> From emperor to exile, his life remains a testament to ambitionâ€™s triumphs and
                                perils.</p>

                            Winston Churchill (1874â€“1965) was a British statesman, orator, and writer who led the United
                            Kingdom through its darkest hour during World War II. Known for his unwavering resolve and
                            stirring speeches, Churchill became a symbol of resistance against Nazi tyranny.

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Born into an aristocratic family, Churchill had a varied career as a soldier, journalist,
                            and politician before becoming Prime Minister in 1940. His leadership during the war,
                            particularly during the Battle of Britain, inspired the nation with famous speeches like "We
                            shall fight on the beaches" and "Their finest hour."</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Despite losing the 1945 election after the war, Churchill remained influential, warning of
                            the Cold Warâ€™s dangers and promoting European unity. A prolific writer, he won the Nobel
                            Prize in Literature in 1953 for his historical works.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p> Remembered as one of historyâ€™s greatest leaders, Churchillâ€™s legacy endures as a testament
                            to courage, determination, and the power of words in times of crisis.

                        <h3>Transcript: Winston Churchill Biography</h3>
                        <p>[Narrator:] "Good evening.
                            My name is Herbert Marshall.
                            I am a summary we will know and connect with.
                            A player of parts, a ledger, if you will, in other people's dreams.
                            Upon request, those of my craft can summon up our tragedy or accommodate.
                            Weep over ancient rounds make fantasy real and
                            reality of things as formless as the mists that roll in come
                            midnight over the coast of Britain.
                            But tonight I come on a different era.
                            The dreams I meddle with are my own and yours.
                            For here with is the story of a man who yet walks among us,
                            whose words you have heard, whose decisions for better or for worse,
                            have mowed at our lives in the ways of generations yet unborn.
                            Next Tuesday, he will be 80 years old.
                            But listen.
                            I am, as I am reminded, an old man.
                            It is proven that all that ate into my use have been accomplished.
                            I have no personal advantage to gain by undertaking one small,
                            the hard and grim duty of leading Britain and our empire.
                            But while God gives me the strength and the people show me that goodwill,
                            it is my duty to try and try I will.
                            Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill, still for him,
                            the two mountain the shouting, the captain to the king.
                            But for us on this birthday eve, time for a looking back.
                            Time to walk again the paths we walked together in less quiet days.
                            Here in Sir Winston's own incomparable words is the story of our time.
                            The pride and the shame, the glory and the pain of it,
                            the tumult and the shouting.
                            The
                            Alistair's Manufacturing Company and in Canada,
                            Alistair's Rumbly Limited and Canadian Alistair's Limited
                            present the tumult and the shouting, an audio biography of Sir Winston Churchill
                            titled his finest hour, a program specially prepared
                            in honor of his 80th birthday next Tuesday.
                            This has been Grower Speaking.
                            In the next 55 minutes or so, we shall bring back the voice of Sir Winston Churchill,
                            a voice caught in its most dramatic moments and held against the year.
                            We shall hear the French Premier when alien boots tramp the streets of Paris.
                            We shall hear Sir Lawrence Olivier, Sir Ray Fritchetton,
                            Lynn Fontaine and a host of Ladies and Gentlemen who,
                            each in his own fashion, wishes to say Happy Birthday.
                            You know, this is an era of spectacular progress,
                            particularly in bringing the good things of life to more and more people.
                            Three important economic measurements of how well we live are these,
                            the abundance of food and fiber we produce,
                            our production and use of electrical energy,
                            and a construction program to match our growing population.
                            Gareth Chalmers seeks to contribute to better living
                            by building key machines necessary for progress in each of these three fields.
                            Consider the need for more construction.
                            Population totals in the United States and Canada are increasing
                            by more than 50,000 every week,
                            almost the equivalent of two new cities, the size of Philadelphia and Ottawa, every year.
                            To house these new citizens, our two countries are building new homes
                            at a rate of more than a million yearly.
                            Consider also that new motor vehicles are going into use
                            at more than double the rate of street and highway construction.
                            That is why each of our countries is giving increased attention to road improvement,
                            with a new $100 billion program under study in the United States.
                            Alice Chalmers builds many of the key machines necessary to such progress.
                            Crawl Attractors, motor scrapers, motor graders and engines for earth moving,
                            logging, mining and pipe laying,
                            branches, screens, cement plants and equipment to help mines and quarries
                            turn out the raw materials of construction.
                            Yes, construction is one of the measuring sticks of progress toward better living.
                            And it is the gratifying work of Alice Chalmers
                            to build machines which contribute to this progress.
                            And now here to guide us on our story of Sir Winston Churchill
                            is one of the most distinguished gentlemen of the American and British theatre,
                            Mr. Herbert Marshall.
                            How do you take the measure of a man?
                            We have learned to gauge a mountain's height
                            to trace the contours of the ocean floor.
                            We can triangulate the miles that stretch from here to the nearest star.
                            But man, this most multitudinous and familiar of creatures,
                            here is mystery.
                            Young Churchill must have been a mystery to one of his schoolmasters,
                            for example, who remembered him only as a somewhat reluctant student
                            who had difficulty pronouncing the letter S.
                            He was born in a rambly old castle, nourished in plenty,
                            molded by traditions older, even than his name.
                            In short, had every opportunity to develop into a typical landed English gentleman
                            respected and honored by his family,
                            and totally unknown beyond the narrow parish wherein he conducted his affairs.
                            But fame is a jealous mistress,
                            and who so would win her favors knows many a rocky road and many a sleepless night.
                            There was war in India,
                            and she had learned the color of blood at a time
                            and most of his fellow students at Sandhurst
                            were still wrestling with the book of regulations.
                            There was a bigger war in France in which he took a bigger part.
                            First Lord of the Admiralty, then
                            the first of many setbacks, demoted, and again, the frontline officer.
                            But even then, those who listened knew that a very special man had come among them.
                            Let me argue this.
                            What subtle, almost mystic, as in the fight thousands and miles across South Africa?
                            All worlds listens.
                            Bloods and great phrases that check the polls, the Norwegians, the Danes, the Dutch,
                            the Belgians, up in all of whom the long night of barbarism will depend
                            on broken, even bare of star of hope.
                            Unless we conquer, and conquer, we must, and conquer, we shall.
                            Prime Minister Winston Churchill called back on his hour of trial,
                            and the story that was over has just begun.
                            Winston Churchill, this man with a face like Mr. Pickwick,
                            and a voice like a swashbuckling Elizabethan, Winston Churchill,
                            a name to conjure will, a man to stand against the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
                            and throw his defiance against the storm.
                            The night he became Prime Minister, May the 10th, it was 1940.
                            A British destroyer slipped out of the harbor at Southampton for the toll duty along the
                            channel.
                            Another ship was coming in.
                            In a matter of seconds, the signal was flashed from the first ship to the second.
                            When is back?
                            And across the dark waters of the bay, there came the echo of cheering
                            as the message was passed from mouth to mouth.
                            When is back?
                            Tell it to the young mother struggling to fit a gas mask
                            on her youngest and uncomprehending son.
                            Tell it to the soldiers poised across the channel to give aid to the retreating French.
                            The English Channel, since time out of mind, a moat to this fortress island,
                            a road to less happy lands, a wall that divides Britain from the world.
                            The sea is calm tonight.
                            The tide is full, the moon lies fair upon the straits.
                            On the French coast, the light gleam and is gone.
                            The clips of England stand glimmering at vast out in the tranquil bay.
                            Come to the window.
                            Sweet is the night air.
                            Only from the long line of spray where the sea meets the moon blanched land,
                            listen, you hear the grating roar of pebbles which the waves draw back and fling
                            at the return of the highest land begin and cease,
                            and then again begin with tremulous cadence flow
                            and bring the eternal note of sadness in.
                            Sophocles long ago heard it on the Aegean,
                            and it brought into his mind the turbid ebb and flow of human misery.
                            We find also in the sound a thought,
                            hearing it by this distant northern sea.
                            The sea of faith was once true at the full,
                            and round earth sure lay like the folds of a bright girdle flow.
                            But now I only hear with melancholy long withdrawing roar,
                            retreating to the breath of a night wind,
                            down the vast edges drear and naked shingles of the world.
                            Our love let us be true to one another.
                            The world which seems to lie before us like a land of dream,
                            so various, so beautiful, so new,
                            have really neither joy nor love nor light,
                            nor certitude nor peace, nor health nor pain.
                            And we are here as on a darkling plane swept with confused alarms
                            of struggled and flight, where ignorant armies clash by night.
                            They managed to sting some of them, God knows how, of their retreat.
                            Long lines trotting down on the beach of country.
                            Whole rigements missing, half their equipment lining the road
                            that stretch back to the channel.
                            The enemy had been too strong, too fast.
                            That day came from the battle not in disorder as frightened men come,
                            but in weirdness and sick and hot as men were been asked to do too much.
                            Dunkirk, a small French town perched on the rim of the waves that gave it birth.
                            Stand where you are, you were the weirdness in your eyes.
                            Rest a moment, you too young to learn what you have learned these last few days.
                            Look to the sea, over the rim of the horizon,
                            in the miracles in the making, a hastily assembled fleet,
                            fishing craft, most of them, occasionally the trim lines of a pleasure craft,
                            an icebox fashioned for champagne, now holding plasma.
                            And so they came back.
                            In Berlin, Hitler smiled and cut his hands like a child,
                            Britain, that most formidable of enemies have been engaged in beaten.
                            Beaten? Not quite.
                            It's June the 19th, 1940.
                            The hospital, the crowd with men who returned.
                            Even as we speak, the Luftwaffe is gathering for the first blow.
                            What now, Mr. Prime Minister?
                            I do not at all under reach the severity of the ordeal which lies before it.
                            For all of us, whatever asks for our station,
                            it will be a help to think of the famous line.
                            In nothing common did or mean.
                            Upon that memorable scene.
                            I, more, freedom shall be restored to all.
                            We'll make nothing of our dust demands.
                            Not one jot or pitel do we receive.
                            Though fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us,
                            Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this island or lose the war.
                            If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be freed,
                            and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sundly uplands.
                            Let us therefore break ourselves to our duty.
                            So bear ourselves with the British Empire and its commonwealths.
                            Last for a thousand years men will still say this, but they are spiny sour.
                            And in this sour, Britain stood alone.
                            Each night was a repetition of the last.
                            Each dawn saw the enemy hasten away like some evil creature who walks only at night.
                            Fire licking at the majestic dome of St. Paul's.
                            Bombs falling on the slums of white chapel and spittle fields,
                            as though to compound the misery already there.
                            Bombs in the palace yard and a king who stands unmoved
                            at the crash of glass on a spintering of wood.
                            These sounds would echo across the world,
                            would be heard of the huge rambly old house that sits back from the street
                            of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C.
                            No matter how many doors were closed against it, the sound came through.
                            You could hear it in Dubuque.
                            You could hear it in Cleveland and medicine hat.
                            Bombs in the sound of marching feet.
                            They rang down every street.
                            The echo beat against your door.
                            President Lincoln said in 1862,
                            those citizens we cannot escape history.
                            We of this Congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves.
                            No personal significance or insignificant can spare one or another of us.
                            The fiery trial through which we pass will light us in honor or dishonor
                            for the latest generation.
                            And so what Mr. Churchill was to call the Grand Alliance began to take form.
                            June the 22nd, 1941, and the world grown familiar with the unbelievable
                            third of the piece of news that's claimed all credulity.
                            In the early hours of the morning, Adolf Hitler had invaded Russia.
                            Like Napoleon before him, he sent his legions,
                            small means of the planes to stretch out beyond the niemen river.
                            Like Napoleon, he spoke contemptuously of the Russian winter, the long nights.
                            The wind that sweeps down out of Siberia like the scab of a sword.
                            Once again in Downing Street.
                            Time for decision.
                            At four o'clock this morning, Hitler attacked and invaded Russia.
                            No one has been a more consistent opponent of communism than I have for the last 25 years.
                            I will unsaid no word that I've spoken about it.
                            Met all this buried away before the spectacle which is now unfolding.
                            The past, when it's crimes, it's follows and it's tragedies flash it away.
                            Any man or state who fights against martyrdom will have our aid.
                            Any man or state who marches with Hitler is our foe.
                            That is our policy and that is our declaration.
                            It follows therefore that we shall give whatever help we can to Russia and to the Russian
                            people.
                            It is not given to the living to see the future.
                            Hitler could not divine the battle of stunning glad,
                            nor could the powers of the West foresee with clarity the twisting tortured way that lay out
                            of stunning glad,
                            but to the West, a star of hope for all free men.
                            Two months after the invasion of Russia, a British ship of war anchored somewhere off the
                            coast of Newfoundland.
                            The sun turned the windless sea into a carpet of sparkling jewels.
                            President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill met on the huge quarter deck and talked
                            like the old friends they were,
                            and from their talks was forged the Atlantic Charter, a map for the path to freedom, a
                            compact of the future.
                            Sunday morning found them with their work done, and in the manner of their powers they found
                            time to give thanks at Sunday morning.
                            Roosevelt sitting there and that old capy loves the well.
                            The Prime Minister next to him smiling is they in the crew joined in singing onward
                            Christian soldiers.
                            We had a church parade on the Sunday in our Atlantic Bay.
                            The President came onto the quarter deck of the Prince of Wales, where there were mingled
                            together many hundreds of American and British sailors and Marines.
                            The sun shone bright and warm, while we all sang the old hymns, which are our common
                            inheritance, and which we learned as children in our homes.
                            When I looked upon that densely packed congregation, the fucking men, it swept across me
                            that here was the only hope,
                            but also the sure hope of saving the world from measureless degradation.
                            And so we came back across the ocean waves.
                            I've lifted in spirit, fortified in resolve.
                            Then I felt that hard and terrible and long drawn out as this struggle may be.
                            We shall not be denied the strength to do our duty to the end.
                            And so the bones were forged, ties the more subtle for being and see.
                            A friendship stronger because of the test that must admit.
                            Capital Hill in Washington, Congress in conventional assemble, stands in tribute to the man
                            who walked slowly, the speaker, Stan.
                            Senate, now so representative, these are not part of the vocabulary of government as he has
                            learned it,
                            but this man is no stranger to any assemblage where English is the language spoken.
                            I cannot help reflecting.
                            This is my father had been American, and my mother, British, instead of the other way
                            around, I might have got here on my own.
                            In that case, this would not have been the first time you would have heard my voice.
                            In that case, I could not have needed any invitation, but if I had, it is hardly likely that
                            it would have been new in animal.
                            So, uh, have things as better as they are.
                            One final word before you returns to his bomb-wrecked homeland.
                            It is December the 24th, 1941, that no sombre, Christmas Eve, that tree has been lighted on
                            the White House lawn,
                            an act of defiance almost on that day.
                            A desperate attempt at make believe, a way of telling yourself in your neighbor that this
                            Christmas will be just like all other Christmases,
                            when we all knew it would not.
                            The president has spoken to the group who came down to watch the ceremony, and now, with the
                            Prime Minister say a few words.
                            Hello soldiers, in the calls, this is a strange Christmas Eve.
                            Almost the whole world is locked in deadly struggle, armed with the most terrible weapons
                            which science can devise.
                            The nations advanced upon each other.
                            You would it be for us this Christmas tide, if we were not sure, that no greed for the land
                            or wealth of any other people,
                            no vulgar ambition, no morbid lust for material gain at the expense of others had led us to
                            the field.
                            He'll would it be for us if that were so.
                            Here in the midst of war, raging and roaring, over all the lands and seas, creeping nearer
                            to our hearts and homes.
                            Here amid all these two mouths, we have tonight the peace of the spirit in each cottage home
                            and in every generous heart.
                            Therefore, we may cast aside for this night at least, the cares and dangers which beset us
                            and make for the children.
                            An evening of happiness in a world of storm.
                            Here then, for one night only, each home throughout the English speaking world should be a
                            brightly lighted island of happiness and peace.
                            Let the children have their nights of fun and laughter.
                            Let the gifts of Father Christmas delight their play.
                            Let us, grown up, share to the poor in their unstinted legends.
                            Before we turn again to the stern, taut and formidable year that lied for us,
                            result that by our sacrifice and daring, these same children shall not erupt of their
                            inheritance
                            or denied their right to live in a free and decent world.
                            And so, in God's mercy, a happy Christmas to you all.
                            We are midway in our 80th birthday tribute to Sir Winston Churchill.
                            We continue after a brief pause for station identification.
                            And again, here is Herbert Marshall.
                            In the four days of time, the final scene was played.
                            It came suddenly, it seemed, too many of us.
                            All at once there were alive soldiers of the gates of Berlin, hit blood dead by his own
                            hand.
                            The German divisions at once seemed invincible were peering down roads that just four years
                            before they had marched in arrogance and victory.
                            Traffic was stopped into Faughur Square.
                            It was the same in Times Square in Melbourne, Toronto, in Atlanta and Oslo,
                            and as before, this voice above all others.
                            The German war is therefore at an end.
                            We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing,
                            but let us not forget for a moment the toils and efforts that lie ahead.
                            Advanced Britannia long live the code of freedom.
                            Faughur Square
                            This royal throne of kings, this septered idol,
                            I'll this earth of majesty this seat of Mars this other Eden demi-parata
                            This fortress built by nature for herself against infection and the hand of war

                            This precious stone set in the silver sea
                            which served it in the office of a wall or as a moat defensive to a house against the envy
                            of
                            less happier land

                            and so we are come to wish a happy birthday to the Prime Minister we who owe him much

                            greatly honored to have been asked to be the spokesman for my 15 million fellow
                            Canadians in this country we recall with heartfelt admiration and gratitude the
                            peerless leadership he gave to us all in the grim days of the war when the
                            Commonwealth unaided was fighting the forces of evil Sir Winston in those days
                            had become far more than the Prime Minister of any one country for all of
                            us his voice was the voice of human freedom and he represented the symbol of
                            the unconquerable spirit of free men and women faced with terrible odds even with
                            victory one Sir Winston chose not to stand on his already matchless record but to
                            continue to devote unstintingly his great talents of statesmanship to

                            freedom in war and in peace and they send affectionate greetings to Sir
                            Winston Churchill on his birthday anniversary and wish him strength for the

                            Sir Winston Churchill reaches today his 80 years surrounded by his glory from
                            time to time people announce that he's going to retire I don't believe it as I
                            know my illustrious friend his secret desire is to die standing addressing the
                            house of comments here's a fighter before the war we fought together to reveal the
                            danger of war to our people and to urge our governments to prepare for war
                            during the war we wear companions in this test after my overthrow in Bordeaux in
                            1940 for refusing to ask an arbiter I always believed in victory in all the
                            presence in which I was held during five years in France and in Germany I never
                            doubted and one of the reasons for my conviction was that Churchill was standing
                            at the helm and in his own land pictures of him in cartridges that have been
                            standing when suspects since the days of the protector the crowds who stand in
                            the rain before Downing Street amply rewarded they feel by a glimpse of his
                            black derby or his hand raised in the vie for victory symbol the difference
                            that is his even the great halls of Windsor Castle this is his reward this
                            and the words from those who love him from London the British Foreign Secretary
                            the right honorable Sir Anthony Eden what I think was trying to all about the
                            tributes which are being paid today to Winston Churchill is that their
                            diversity and variety this very fact is the measure of his grandeur and
                            quality there have been many many now generation to me every that great might
                            be applied choose all accomplishment the knowledge of the language and his
                            understanding of the colloquial this gromarian took exception to a sentence
                            which ended with a preposition not wishing to make a major issue of it he
                            simply placed a red exclamation point next to the offending word when the
                            script was returned to Churchill he got very angry he refused to change a single
                            word and under the classic reply such Aaron Pedentry I cannot up with put but
                            perhaps a humor like this prose which the new height during the war it was so
                            Winston himself who spread the story of an audience given by the King and
                            himself to an American banker at the time when the outlook was blackest for
                            England London is being raided nightly the King is supposed to have said
                            Ramon may capture soo as India's infirmence Japan minuses Australia what
                            to do what to do the American considered gravely according to sir
                            Winston and then suggested the majesty if I were you I'd put Canada in the Queen's
                            name America and Britain the old world and the new we got to know each other
                            pretty well in those years when Britain played host to the young men and women
                            with the US on the colors of their uniforms but not quite well enough it
                            remained for an American woman to write the lines that will I think for ever
                            interpret Britain to America and America to Britain miss Alice newer Miller gave
                            us the story of an American girl who married an Englishman and I would
                            listen miss Lynn Fontaine in the reading from the white cliffs of Dover
                            later than many earlier than some I knew that I was cast that war must come
                            that war must come night after night I lay stealing a broken heart to face the
                            day when he my son would tread the very same path that his father tried when the
                            day came I was not still not ready foolish wild words issued from my lips my
                            child my child why should you die for England too he smiled is she not worth
                            it if I must he said John would have answered yes but John was dead is she
                            worth dying for my love my one and only love her died and now his son asks me
                            his alien mother to a say the worth of England to mankind today I thought of
                            my father's deep traditional wrath against England the Redcoat bully the
                            ancient soul that second reaping of hate that after mass of a ruler's polyan
                            ignorance long ago long long ago yet who can honestly say England is utterly
                            changed not I not I arrogance ignorance poly are here today and for these my
                            son must die I thought of these years these last dark terrible years when the
                            rulers of England they the English believe lies as the price of peace lies
                            and fears lies the corrupt and fears that happen to see rulers of England for
                            them must I send out my only son to die and then and then I thought of the
                            history of Englishman of Queen Elizabeth stepping down over the stones of
                            Plymouth town to greet the men who had sailed away from rocky inlet and wooded
                            bay free man undisciplined uncontrolled some of them pirates all of the mold
                            feeling their fate was England state coming to save it a little late much too
                            late for the easy way much too late and yet never quite too late to win in that
                            last worst fight men who have governed England know that dreadful line that
                            they may not pass even Elizabeth long ago honored and loved and bold as brass
                            daring and subtle arrogant clever yet even the great Elizabeth never dared
                            oppose the sullen might of the English standing upon our right and were they
                            not English are for father's never more English than when they shook the dust of
                            her sod from their feet forever angrily seeking ashore where in his own way a
                            man might worship his god never more English than when they dared be rebels
                            against her that stern intractable sense of that which no man can stomach and
                            still be free writing when in the course of human events writing it out so all the
                            world could see when come the powers of all just governments the tree of liberty
                            grew and changed and spread but the seed was English I am American bread I have
                            seen much to hate here much to forgive but in a world where England is finished
                            and dead I do not wish to live
                            friend this is Ben Grower again probably no one machine has contributed as much to
                            our abundance of food and fiber as the farm tractor one of agriculture's great
                            steps forward came when Alice Chalmers introduced the rubber tire tractor another
                            came with the adaptation of tractors combine harvesters and other power
                            equipment to the family size farm introduced more recently by Alice
                            Chalmers was a machine called the roto baylor which makes weather resistant
                            round bales and now there's a farage harvester which brings pasture to the
                            capital in the feedlot cutting the cost of producing milk and beef today Alice
                            Chalmers practice and equipment with many new conveniences and advantages can be
                            bought for fewer bushels of wheat or corn or fewer pounds of cotton or livestock than
                            previous to world war two a sound and prosperous agriculture is essential to a
                            healthy economy and Alice Chalmers continues to pioneer in building power farm
                            equipment which brings better living better farming and more profit to the family farm
                            Marshall so we come almost to the present Fulton Missouri president Truman and
                            prime minister Churchill sit on a small platform on the college grounds both a
                            little in Congress in their academic robes Mr. Churchill rises to speak no one
                            knows that within seconds a new phase is to be added to the English language
                            an iron curtain has descended across the continent behind that line by all the
                            capitals of the ancient states of central and eastern Europe Warsaw Berlin Prague
                            Vienna Budapest Belgrade Bucharest and Stapia
                            It was the end of an era and the beginning of the new but even as we listen to this
                            voice their needs must fall a shadow across the room for the time will come
                            when we will never again hear a new speech from this man or turn a fresh page in
                            the writings that seem to flow like some inexhaustible stream from his study
                            you who would write listen first to this writing a book isn't adventure to begin
                            where it is a toy and an amusement and then it becomes a mistress and then he
                            becomes a master and then he becomes a tyrant and the last phase is that just
                            that you are about to be reconciled to your servitude near you you kill the
                            monster and bring him about to the public the more we preserve our language
                            see it is not unduly unduly damaged by modern slang adaptations and intruders
                            I was shocked the other day to hear the Chancellor of the Kekka use the word
                            quantify whether that before I hope you will never hear it again
                            I believe it was a substitute but estimate well let us be careful of that
                            another odious expression is that it's very common use which is to say in short
                            supply so why can't you say scarce broadly speaking the short words are the
                            best and the old words when short are the best are the best of all
                            somebody said that the only events that pass into history are those which some
                            men wrote memorably about well certainly there are people who never heard of
                            Texas if you can imagine anyone so benighted who have heard of the alamo
                            because one man who knew a little Greek once said about it thermopoli had its
                            messengers of defeat the alamo had none this is mr.
                            Amristor Koch of the Manchester Guardian long and observer of the American scene
                            and a very special student of what I suppose will be called the Churchillian
                            language mr. Koch we are honoring tonight the most many-sided man since
                            Leonardo da Vinci and it's my privilege to talk to you for a couple of minutes
                            about the side of him that guarantees immortality to all the others the lucky
                            fact that he writes better than all contemporary men of events and so has
                            become already his own best historian anybody who has ever read a page of
                            Churchill or heard him talk is aware of being in the presence of a man who
                            enjoys the big gesture and the grand adjective so do all politicians but they
                            go to the same tawdry costume house to clothe their thoughts whereas as a
                            ghostwriter once reminded a despairing president Churchill rolls his own in one
                            speech he could describe the war to the House of Commons as a stand against a
                            monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark lamentable catalog of human
                            crime and a month later he simply told the same audience get used to the
                            bombings eels get used to skinning some will always remember his language in
                            full regalia and some will prefer his rapier in the house at four o'clock this
                            morning Hitler invaded Russia all his usual formalities of perfidy were
                            scrupulously observed he is unique in being able to handle the ordinary
                            English sentence with equal mastery as a diamond encrusted sword a big stick or a
                            peashooter but he could have all this and still be merely the most eloquent
                            politician of our time what will make him unforgettable I think is the
                            miraculous coincidence that he was the best historian of tremendous events in
                            which he was also the chief actor it is as if Gibbon had been also the most
                            eminent of the Roman emperors Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill a name to
                            conjure with a giant who walks among us a voice to interpret what has gone
                            before and to give new meaning to the ancient words courage and honor and
                            dignity it is usual for gentlemen who reach an advanced age to be asked to give
                            a piece of advice for those who will come after so Winston has performed this
                            duty as he has all the others listen out of the wisdom of the past a sign
                            pose to the future if the human race we used to have a prolonged and
                            indefinite period of material prosperity they've already got to behave in a
                            peaceful and helpful way towards one another and science will do for them all
                            that they wish and more than they can dream nothing is final change is unceasing
                            and it is very likely that mankind has a lot more to learn before they come to
                            their journey then we might even find ourselves in a few years moving along a
                            broad smooth callway of peace and plenty instead of roaming and peering round
                            along the room of hell thus we may by patience courage and in orderly
                            progression reach someday with God's blessing the shelter of a karma and kind
                            their age
                            Winston then would stand for Churchill hold his words against the years his
                            right will not again pass this way in our lifetime nor yet in the allotted time
                            of our children how shall we take the measure of this man of all the words of
                            spill from his pen there is one short passage that perhaps above all else shows
                            us the workings of his mind and heart we have heard these words before they were
                            spoken not in victory but in defeat they were spoken not in the confidence of
                            youth but in the twilight of age he had just been defeated for re-election at
                            the end of the war a few supporters came to his home that night to give
                            condolences he spoke briefly to him and let it be known to all of us around the
                            world
                            I am as I am reminded an old man it is true that all the daydreamed of my
                            use have been accomplished I have no personal advantage to gain by undertaking
                            one small hard and grim duty of leading button and our empire but while God gives
                            me the strength and the people show me that goodwill this is my duty to try and
                            try I will
