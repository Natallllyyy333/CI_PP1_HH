                                Born in Corsica in 1769, Napoleon quickly advanced through military ranks during the
                                French Revolution. By 1799, he seized power in a coup, declaring himself First
                                Consul.
                                In 1804, he crowned himself Emperor, consolidating absolute authority..

                                    Napoleonâ€™s military genius expanded French dominance across Europe. Victories at
                                    Austerlitz and Jena made him feared, while legal reforms like the Napoleonic Code
                                    modernized governance. However, constant wars drained France and provoked
                                    resistance.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The disastrous 1812 invasion of Russia marked the beginning of the end. Defeated by
                                    a
                                    coalition of European powers, Napoleon was forced to abdicate in 1814 and was exiled
                                    to
                                    Elba. He escaped in 1815, briefly reclaiming power during the "Hundred Days," but
                                    his
                                    final defeat at Waterloo sealed his fate.</p>
                                <h4>Final Exile</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The British exiled Napoleon to the remote island of Saint Helena in the South
                                    Atlantic.
                                    There, he lived in isolation until his death in 1821. Despite his fall, Napoleonâ€™s
                                    legacy endures in law, military strategy, and the reshaping of Europe.</p>

                                <p> From emperor to exile, his life remains a testament to ambitionâ€™s triumphs and
                                    perils.</p>

                                <p>
                                    The stage is set for a magnificent coronation, not of a king but an emperor. Twelve
                                    thousand guests wait in the freezing cold. Crowds line the streets of Paris, hoping
                                    for a glimpse of the carriage procession on its way to the splendour of the
                                    Cathedral of Notre-Dame for the crowning of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1804.
                                </p>
                                <p>


                                    Meanwhile, over a thousand kilometres away in Vienna, when news of Napoleon's
                                    coronation reaches the ears of the German composer Ludwig van Beethoven, he explodes
                                    into rage, incensed that the leader who had claimed to embody the republican ideals
                                    of the French Revolution had made himself emperor. And reaching for the manuscript
                                    of his third Eroica Symphony, Beethoven scratches out the dedication to Napoleon,
                                    pressing so hard that it leaves a hole in the paper. The story may be apocryphal,
                                    but it shows how far the French ruler Napoleon Bonaparte has divided opinion ever
                                    since he rose to fame and power in the closing years of France's revolutionary
                                    decade.

                                    Today, 250 years on since his birth, he's still seen as a visionary, ambitious
                                    statesman and brilliant military commander by some, but others criticise him as a
                                    master of manipulation, a racist and a dictator whose insatiable thirst for power
                                    led to the deaths of millions across Europe.

                                    So to discuss the man and myth of Napoleon Bonaparte, I'm joined on today's forum
                                    from Paris by Annie Jourdain, Associate Professor of European Studies at the
                                    University of Amsterdam and the author of numerous books on the French Empire and
                                    the French Revolution. From Gainesville in the United States by Professor Rafe
                                    Blautfarp, who leads Florida State University's Institute on Napoleon and the French
                                    Revolution. And in London in the UK, we have Kate Asprey, Professor of French
                                    Studies at the University of Warwick, where she lectures on the literature and
                                    culture of 18th and 19th century France. Welcome to all three of you.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And a brief question to all three of you to start with. We heard just now how
                                    Beethoven changed his mind about Napoleon when he declared himself emperor. So I
                                    wonder, what do you think you would have made of Napoleon if you'd met him today?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Kate, you first, briefly. The British were not exactly Napoleon's favourite, and I'm
                                    not entirely sure he would have offered me an audience at St Helena in exile. But
                                    one of the things that as a scholar most interests me is this contrast between the
                                    daring, dashing, revolutionary general and the dictator who shows a callous contempt
                                    for loss of life, and yet the army remains loyal to him.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Annie, what about you? You will not see me. He did not like intellectual women, and
                                    I don't like despotic leaders. So I think we would have no contacts. So it would
                                    have been a very frosty encounter if it had happened at all.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Rafe, what about you? Well, I would have first felt fear because as a university
                                    professor, I often don't encounter greatness. But then after the fear, I would feel
                                    a temptation because Napoleon used intellectuals and artists to serve his political
                                    purpose. Would I be like Beethoven and have the courage to say no, or would I
                                    sacrifice my intellectual honesty and freedom for the lure of prestige and position
                                    and wealth? An intriguing question.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Let's begin with Napoleon's childhood because it's interesting that this most famous
                                    of French leaders wasn't born on the French mainland at all. He came from the
                                    Mediterranean island of Corsica, which had a history of changing hands between
                                    warring European states. In 1769, the year when Napoleon was born, it had just been
                                    sold to the French.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Kate, tell us a bit about those early years of Napoleon's. So Napoleon comes from a
                                    Corsican noble family. And traditionally in the 18th century system, the second son,
                                    which was Napoleon, was destined for the military. His family were well respected on
                                    the island. His father was a lawyer and quite closely associated with the separatist
                                    movement that was pushing for an independent Corsica. But options on the island for
                                    an ambitious family were somewhat limited, which is why Napoleon's father decided to
                                    send the two oldest sons to France to be educated.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And Rafe, Napoleon was nine years old at this point, wasn't he? What happened when
                                    he arrived in France? It must have been a very difficult adjustment for the young
                                    Napoleon. The weather in France is considerably colder than in Corsica and the
                                    French language was foreign to him. Napoleon was a Corsican and naturally spoke the
                                    Corsican language rather than French. He was teased mercilessly by the other
                                    children for his thick Corsican accent. And in fact, even as emperor of France, he
                                    never lost that accent. But he proved to be an exceptionally gifted student. So the
                                    military school administrators plucked him out of the school because of his math
                                    abilities and sent him for extra training at an artillery school, a specialized
                                    artillery school, where he learned to become an artillery officer. And after
                                    finishing that schooling, he was placed in an artillery regiment at the young age of
                                    16.

                                    And Annie, Napoleon at this point was heavily into books, wasn't he? And even
                                    fancied himself as a bit of a writer and a philosopher. How important was this to
                                    the person he was to become? He was reading a lot, so Romans and Greeks, but also
                                    Machiavelli, the political philosopher. Well, that's interesting because he wrote
                                    about power, didn't he? Which has become very relevant to Napoleon. I think it is
                                    very important for his political thinking. And he was a supporter of Rousseau, whose
                                    social contract of 1762 was an inspiration for the revolutionaries.

                                    Let's just pause for a moment to sketch out what was happening in France at the
                                    time, because this is a period of extraordinary ferment, culminating in the French
                                    Revolution, which swept away the ancient regime of the French monarchy in 1789, when
                                    Napoleon was just turning 20. Kate, can you paint us a picture of this politically
                                    tumultuous time in France?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    OK, so in 1789, the storming of the Bastille marked the beginning of an attempt to
                                    regenerate France. The revolutionaries hoped that they could create a shared form of
                                    power between the nation and the king, which would be summed up in the revolutionary
                                    motto of liberty, equality and fraternity. The problem was that the king was
                                    reluctant to cede any of the privileges that the nobility and the church had
                                    traditionally held on to. So there was increasing conflict between his vision of
                                    maintaining an absolutist monarchy and the revolutionaries' desire for the nation to
                                    be sovereign.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But then it turns sour, doesn't it? And then we come to the period which is called
                                    the terror. What happens there? So after the monarchy has been abolished and the
                                    republic is declared in 1792, the revolution takes a more radical turn. And we find
                                    that a group of politicians called the Jacobins take control and try and use virtue
                                    and terror as a means of governing the country. Even if Louis has his head chopped
                                    off by the guillotine in January 1793, Marie Antoinette follows him to the scaffold
                                    in October 1793. There is still a very real threat that monarchy might be restored.
                                    And so the terrorists, the Jacobins, try and purge the revolution and try and push
                                    everybody on to confirm the gains of the revolution on the basis that you are either
                                    for the revolution or against it. There can't be any gradation in your support for
                                    the revolution.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And Rafe, when all this was going on, the revolution and then the terror, where was
                                    Napoleon in all of this? Napoleon, when the revolution broke out, was immediately
                                    full of enthusiasm and optimism. He had dreamed of liberty as a young man. After
                                    all, he had been reading Rousseau, as Ani said, and he decided to get directly
                                    involved in politics. So what he did for the first four years of the revolution was
                                    to take as much leave from his regiment as possible to first try to get his family
                                    members and friends elected to political office and then ultimately to get himself
                                    elected to political office, always within a Corsican frame of reference.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So do we have any inkling at this stage that Napoleon might become a great leader?
                                    There's absolutely no inkling that he will become a great military leader. France
                                    has been at war for now nearly two years, and he has done everything he could to
                                    avoid ever having to be near the army. So not a military leader, but possibly a
                                    political genius. He's certainly a political animal. And yet, if you roll forward up
                                    to the year 1795, Napoleon manages to go from beinga mere second lieutenant in the
                                    artillery regiment to the rank of general. How does he manage to do that? He manages
                                    to marry his military position and his military training with his political
                                    instinct. What he does, in brief, between 1793 and 1795, is he places himself in a
                                    position to be the revolutionary government's leading political general, who can
                                    save the revolution from very, very difficult circumstances by military force. He
                                    oversees the liberation of Toulon, a city in the south of France that has gone over
                                    to the royalists and has been occupied by the British.

                                <p>
                                    And then a couple years later, in 1795, when he leads pro-revolutionary military
                                    forces in crushing a very threatening right-wing royalist popular revolt, it is for
                                    his loyalty to the revolutionary government, his willingness to use force, that he
                                    is rewarded and that he rises in prominence. He becomes the revolutionary
                                    government's military strongman.

                                <p>
                                    So here we are in 1795. He's a young military general. His great war campaigns are
                                    still to come. And Napoleon has another encounter, this time romantic rather than
                                    military, and it was to prove decisive.

                                    Paris, December 1795. I awake all filled with you. Your image and the intoxicating
                                    pleasures of last night allow my senses no rest. Sweet and much less Josephine, how
                                    strangely you work upon my heart. Are you angry with me? Are you unhappy? Are you
                                    upset? My soul is broken with grief and my love for you forbids repose. In three
                                    hours I shall see you again. Till then, a thousand kisses, mio dolce amor. But give
                                    me none back, for they set my blood on fire. A letter from an infatuated young
                                    Napoleon to his soon-to-be bride, Josephine de Beauharnais.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Kate, can you tell us about Josephine?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Josephine was born on Martinique to a plantation-owning family, had come to France
                                    to be married in a marriage of convenience, had had two children, EugÃ¨ne and
                                    Hortense, who ironically will be two of the most loyal supporters of Napoleon right
                                    to the end, his stepchildren. She narrowly escapes being executed. Her husband, who
                                    she'd already separated from, wasn't so lucky. He was guillotined during the
                                    revolution. So she finds herself alone and without a protector. And it's at that
                                    point that Napoleon meets her. She is in need, as a woman of a certain age now, with
                                    two children. She's in need of someone who's on the way up. So she sees him as a
                                    useful stepping stone to cementing her position as a woman of the world. And he sees
                                    her as an opportunity to find support to marry the old nobility with the new society
                                    of the revolution.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It does seem as though Napoleon fell madly in love with Josephine, and they do get
                                    married, don't they? But it seems also that his love wasn't reciprocated. He was
                                    crazy about her, but soon very disappointed, since she was unfaithful and had
                                    lovers. And she was more interested in clothes and jewels than anything else. In
                                    fact, a mere two days after the wedding, Napoleon left Josephine in Paris and headed
                                    off for the battlefield to pursue his other great love, the desire for power.

                                    In the next few years, up till 1799, were extraordinarily successful for Napoleon in
                                    military terms.
                                </p>

                                    Riff, can you briefly summarise why?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Well, he was given command of one of the French field armies, the Army of Italy, as
                                    a reward for his political loyalty in suppressing counter-revolutionary violence. No
                                    one expected it, but he leads these armies of Italy to a series of brilliant
                                    victories that are still studied today in the military academies of the world, and
                                    ends up crushing France's main continental European opponent, Austria. He defeats
                                    their armies and forces Austria to sign a humiliating and decisive peace treaty.
                                    Significantly, Napoleon negotiates that treaty and imposes terms on Austria on his
                                    own, without any authority from his government.He is already acting as if he is an
                                    independent political force. This is going to lead to his next campaign, which is
                                    the conquest of Egypt, a campaign that the government is happy to send him on
                                    because it gets him away from France. They're beginning to be afraid of this
                                    successful, popular political general. And Napoleon likes it too because he realizes
                                    he needs another opportunity to acquire glory and enhance his reputation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And talking about that reputation, one key to understanding Napoleon's extraordinary
                                    success as leader is the mastery he showed not just in his military campaigns, but
                                    also the publicity campaigns to promote his foreign achievements back home in
                                    France. Annie, he was an extraordinary self-publicist, wasn't he? He understood very
                                    well and very soon that public opinion was important for his career. So in Italy, he
                                    created two newspapers to celebrate his exploits. And during this time, he and his
                                    artist are creating a first image of Bonaparte, the image of a young hero.

                                <p>
                                    So Kate, Napoleon was already turning to artists to project a certain image of
                                    himself, even before he'd come to power. He recognized from the start the power of
                                    the visual image. Some of the best examples would include:
                                </p>
                                <p>




                                    A painting by Gros of him on the bridge at Arcole, where he is the inspiring
                                    revolutionary general clutching the flag that's going to inspire the troops, the
                                    revolutionary colours very clear in the way in which the picture is painted to give
                                    us that sense that this is the man who's able to take the revolution forward and out
                                    of France to other areas.

                                    David's painting of him crossing the Alps would be another example where David puts

                                    crossed the Alps. But Napoleon himself is on a magnificent horse, the cloak swirling
                                    around him, completely unrealistic compared to the reality of him clutching on to a
                                    mule for dear life as he crossed the Alps in terrible weather. The reality is less
                                    important than the image of him as the saviour of France.

                                    But he can't control what happens outside of France. Although increasingly he's able
                                    to manipulate and control the image of himself within a French context. He can't
                                    control how he's seen elsewhere. And one of the most creative parts of the
                                    Napoleonic period is how artists outside of France represent him in caricature. So
                                    the British in particular have a field day presenting him in political cartoons. The
                                    Germans see him as in league with the devil. And yet the caricaturists have a
                                    sneaking admiration for him because he upsets the political status quo. So even the
                                    caricatures are doing his work for him, building him up. To a certain extent, yes.

                                    Well, in 1798, following his military successes in Italy and Austria, as we heard,
                                    Napoleon embarked on a military expedition to Egypt. And while there, word reached
                                    him of a plan to overthrow the French government. So he returned to Paris to take
                                    advantage of the political instability. And then in the last few months of 1799, he
                                    positioned himself to take over and succeeded in seizing power in a military coup.

                                    Rafe, what's extraordinary about this moment, it seems to me, is that even though
                                    he's using a military coup to turn himself into an all-powerful leader, Napoleon
                                    claims he's taking on the mantle and the ideas of the Republic, of the French
                                    Revolution. So how did he convince everyone in France that he was doing the thing
                                    they wanted him to do? He didn't convince everybody, but he sure convinced a lot of
                                    people. Mainly, I think he won over the mass of French people by restoring stability
                                    to a country that had been wracked by a decade of factional violence, economic
                                    turmoil, international war. After 10 years of upheaval, people are often willing to
                                    accept stability at virtually any price. But Napoleon did not make them pay any
                                    price. He retained a central principle of the Revolution, the one that arguably the
                                    French people cherished above all others, and that principle was equality. Napoleon
                                    ensured throughout his entire rule that French people remained equal before the law,
                                    enjoyed equal rights. What he took away from them was their political liberty.

                                    Annie, what's your take on this? Equality was respected, but not equality between
                                    elite and workers, not equality between men and women, etc. So it was a meritocratic
                                    codification, but only for white men.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So what sort of reforms helped consolidate his power? Rafe? Napoleon realized
                                    immediately upon taking power that if he wanted his regime to last, if he wanted to
                                    stabilize his rule, he needed to reconcile French Catholics to it. So he wasted no
                                    time in negotiating what amounted to a treaty between the French state and the Roman
                                    papacy to restore the open practice of Catholicism in France. It respected a number
                                    of important revolutionary gains. The most important of those revolutionary gains
                                    was the principle of religious freedom, the freedom for French citizens to worship
                                    whatever religion or whatever god they pleased. That one reform, the Concordat,
                                    managed to reconcile the majority of French people to his rule and pulled the rug
                                    out from under the counter-revolution, which had drawn its force really from
                                    Catholic sentiment against everything that had happened since 1789.

                                <p>
                                    And Kate, one of the most significant developments Napoleon oversaw was the civil
                                    code. What was this? Why was it important? The civil code was a document that
                                    rationalized and confirmed the gains of the revolution in organizing a legal system
                                    that would apply across France and therefore provide a unifying factor for France.
                                    If we look at France today, it's his organization of education and his organization
                                    of the way in which the departments are structured that we see the legacies actually
                                    in his systems rather than in his military victories.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So the civil code guarantees:





                                    An end to feudalism.
                                </p>
                                <p>


                                    An end to primogeniture, where the oldest son inherits.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So there's a sharing of inheritance, which is a big move away from how things had
                                    been done before. But he also starts to attempt to re-establish a more authoritarian
                                    approach to the organization of the family unit. So the father is given greater
                                    powers over children, including the opportunity of locking them up if they
                                    misbehave. In the civil code, we find that it becomes much more difficult to get
                                    divorced. So there's a move towards creating in miniature in the family unit an
                                    authoritarian patriarchal system that, in effect, he's imposing on the country as a
                                    whole.
                                </p>

                                    One of the other main achievements of Napoleon's first years in office was peace
                                    across Europe for the first time in a decade. Yet that much-needed stability was
                                    short-lived. Napoleon couldn't keep away from the battlefield for long. In little
                                    more than a year, he was already pushing the frontiers of his growing empire.

                                    That music was played at Napoleon's coronation in December 1804, when he crowned
                                    himself emperor of the French in front of 12,000 invited guests, as well as the
                                    Pope. And Kate, he'd already made himself first consul for life when he took power.
                                    So why wasn't that enough? Why did he have to be emperor too? I think Napoleon felt
                                    that he wasn't on a par with the other monarchs of Europe as simply first consul for
                                    life. There was a real fear that without Napoleon, France would slip back into
                                    chaos. There had been a number of threats to his life in the first few years of his
                                    time in power. Making himself emperor was an attempt then to try and reassert a
                                    sense of stability and give the country a direction that would steer it away from
                                    the danger of slipping back into the ancien regime.

                                    And how did that go down with the French, Rafe? Because here was a man making
                                    himself emperor in a country where the citizens had only just got rid of their
                                    monarchy in 1789. The French Revolution had fundamentally been about ending the
                                    hereditary possession of political power by elite families or by a monarch. And
                                    here, Napoleon is beginning to turn directly away from some fundamental principles
                                    of the revolution. It doesn't help that once he becomes an emperor, he surrounds
                                    himself with anopulent court, a whole series of palaces. He took the occupied
                                    countries of Europe, the countries his armies had conquered, and placed his brothers
                                    on thrones in those countries. So his brother Louis becomes king of Holland, his
                                    brother Jerome becomes king of Westphalia, a country he carves out of central
                                    Germany, and every one of these brothers is given a court with nobles and lackeys,
                                    and all of this weakens Napoleon's ties to the energy and legitimacy of the
                                    revolution.

                                    So how much popular opposition was there to this old Napoleon who'd made himself
                                    emperor? There was no freedom of expression. In fact, all but four government
                                    newspapers were suppressed. Dissent is reported on and squelched really before it
                                    can generate any sort of momentum.

                                    And Annie, elsewhere in the world, beyond France, in the other territories he
                                    conquered, how successful was he there? Because he was also imposing his civil code
                                    on these areas, wasn't he? Yes, and he has many opposition there. But it was very
                                    difficult to oppose Napoleon because of the police. The opposition had to wait until
                                    1813, after the defeat in Moscow, in Russia.

                                    Napoleon's greatest victories, the Battle of Austerlitz, his greatly outnumbered
                                    soldiers succeeded in defeating the combined forces of some of his long-standing
                                    enemies. But then the tide began to turn. As the folk song we heard there suggested,
                                    Napoleon, or Bony, as he was known in Britain, found himself facing not just one
                                    enemy but several, the Russians, the Prussians and the British. And instead of
                                    winning battles, as he was accustomed to doing, he started to lose them.

                                    So, Rafe, where and why did it all go wrong? I suppose that you could point to
                                    Napoleon's very ill-advised invasion of Spain in 1808. When Napoleon sends French
                                    armies into Spain to impose his own older brother Joseph as king of Spain, it sparks
                                    a massive uprising and a very bloody guerrilla war throughout the country. That
                                    guerrilla uprising in Spain against French occupation costs the French army
                                    approximately 100 soldiers' lives a day, a constant drain. And the French are never,
                                    never really able to gain control of the country. So it's almost as though power
                                    went to his head. He overreached himself.

                                    The way I like to explain it to my students is via the story of Elvis Presley. Your
                                    listeners may be familiar with a younger incarnation of Elvis, the Elvis that took
                                    the world by storm, the young black-clad Elvis with his dangerous pelvis. Contrast
                                    that with the later Elvis, the older, heavy Elvis, the Elvis dressed in white with
                                    feathers performing for millions of dollars in Las Vegas. That's the difference. The
                                    young, lean, revolutionary Bonaparte gives way to the increasingly portly,
                                    overconfident, lazy Emperor Napoleon.

                                    In his unstoppable quest for power and to secure his legacy, Napoleon looked for new
                                    alliances across Europe. At home, his wife Josephine, unable to bear him a child,
                                    was sidelined and the two divorced in 1809.

                                    Annie, who did Napoleon set his sights on next by way of a wife? The daughter of the
                                    Austrian Emperor, Marie-Louise, and it was a mistake because she was the family from
                                    Marie-Antoinette who went to the scaffold. But Napoleon got the child he wanted to
                                    have and began to think that he was a legitimate emperor. And it is there that he
                                    lost his sense of reality, I think.

                                    And this was a very convenient marriage for Napoleon, wasn't it, as you say? I think
                                    he's quoted as saying, I'm marrying a womb. Rafe, did this alliance work for
                                    Napoleon? I mean, did it achieve the desired effect? Because he was also trying to
                                    achieve an understanding withthe Russians, wasn't he, to further his ambitions? To
                                    get the Russians in line, to subdue them and make them follow his will, Napoleon
                                    finally decides to invade that vast empire. In the summer of 1812, he marches an
                                    army of 600,000 European soldiers, not just French, into Russia. The following
                                    winter, only 100,000 survivors come struggling back. It's the worst military
                                    disaster that Napoleon will ever face. And that campaign against Russia in 1812 is,
                                    of course, immortalized in Tolstoy's epic War and Peace, which shows his army being
                                    defeated in the end by the superior force of General Winter, stuck in freezing
                                    Russia with no supply lines.

                                    Why, Rafe, do you think it had all Napoleon's good sense that he'd shown in the
                                    past? Why that good sense deserted him on this campaign? I'm not really sure,
                                    although I think it's symptomatic of Napoleon's approach to the broad problems of
                                    grand strategy, of geopolitical strategy. He always ended up having the same
                                    solution to every major international problem, which was he had to defeat his
                                    opponents and subdue them. The idea of making very serious concessions in exchange
                                    for a peace that he and the other European rulers could live with was very alien
                                    from his mentality. He had to dominate. And the only solution he can think of to
                                    Russia's independence, which he can't tolerate anyway, is to try to crush it. But
                                    the Russian Empire is just too big of a nut to crack.

                                    Well, the worst was yet to come for Napoleon because the countries across Europe who
                                    were against him, Austria, Russia and Britain, were forging new alliances in a bid
                                    to defeat him once and for all. As they marched on Paris, the French authorities
                                    negotiated with the Allies to remove Napoleon, who then abdicated in April 1814.
                                    There is no personal sacrifice, not even that of life itself, he declared, which he
                                    is not willing to make for the interests of France.

                                    So, Kate, tell us what happened next, because it's by no means the end of the story,
                                    is it? He's sent to the island of Elba. Just off the coast of Italy. Just off the
                                    coast of Italy, so really not very far away. There he's treated as a sovereign,
                                    although now the land over which he has sovereignty is much smaller than the French
                                    Empire had been. Louis XVIII, who was Louis XVI's brother, returns to France and we
                                    have a restoration of the monarchy. Napoleon is well aware that the army is
                                    dissatisfied with the return of the monarch. He's also very aware that Louis XVIII
                                    perhaps not live up to the ideal image of the perfect monarch. So he hatches an
                                    audacious plan to return to France. The French call it the Vol de l'Aigle, the
                                    flight of the eagle. He sets sail from Elba, he lands on the south coast of France,
                                    and makes it back to Paris without a drop of blood being spilled, because the army
                                    go back over to his side. So we have him reinstated as emperor in Paris. We have
                                    what we now call the Hundred Days. At the time it wasn't called that because no one
                                    knew how long Napoleon would remain in power. He tries to play on his popular
                                    legitimacy, saying that the people want me. Look, I've arrived back in Paris.
                                    Everybody wants me as emperor. I have the legitimacy.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But the Allies feel that he's a threat to the security of Europe. And so very
                                    quickly we end up with a battle, the battle that we will call the Battle of
                                    Waterloo, where Napoleon is defeated. He ends up abdicating for a second time and
                                    surrenders to the British when it becomes clear that he's not going to be able to
                                    escape to America. And this time the Allies are determined to get Napoleon well away
                                    from Europe. No longer Elba, an island just off the coast of Italy, but he's sent to
                                    one of the world's most remote islands. If you talk to St. Helens, for example, and
                                    I'm a St. Helenian, we refer to the outside world. It's almost as though we exist in
                                    isolation. The isolation is a challenge for some people, realizing that there is
                                    nothing for 1,500 miles. It does take sometimes six to eight weeks to get post. I've
                                    actually posted a postcard from Central America, Guatemala, to St. Helena Island in
                                    September last year, and I received my card from Guatemala in February.

                                    The voices of residents of St. Helena, a British colony in the South Atlantic, 3,000
                                    kilometres from the coast of Brazil and almost 2,000 kilometres west of Africa. They
                                    were recorded in a programme for BBC Radio 4 in 2016, produced by Sarah-Jane
                                    Hall.And Rafe, it's a sorry end to Napoleon's story, isn't it? I'm not sure it was a
                                    sorry end for him. It would have been a sorry end for you or me or most ordinary
                                    people, but he is able to cast himself as a great martyr. It would have been
                                    terrible if he had just retired somewhere and cultivated his little garden. That
                                    would not have sat well with the myth he was trying to build. So to a large extent,
                                    the reason that we do know about him and know about his myth is that during his five
                                    or six years of exile on the island, he dictated no fewer than four autobiographies
                                    and memoirs. And it's from these literary attempts to fashion his image for
                                    posterity that we have this legend of Napoleon that is so gripping and so
                                    fascinating.

                                <p>
                                    Annie, as Rafe alluded to there, Napoleon fashioned an image for himself to define
                                    how history would remember him. What has been his reputation in the years since his
                                    death? In Poland, he was seen as a Christ-like figure. In other countries, he's seen
                                    as a self-made man, the incarnation of modernity for American people, for example.
                                    And philosophers like Nietzsche have seen him as someone beyond good and evil,
                                    someone you cannot judge because he has not the same human qualities than normal
                                    people. So what remains now is the simple figure of Napoleon, the one who everybody
                                    knows, the little man with his uniform. This is the neutral symbol of Napoleon.

                                    Rafe, I was wondering what do you think his influence has been around the world as
                                    an inspiration for other leaders over the years? Let me just mention the case of
                                    Latin America. Actually, as a result of the Napoleonic Wars, the Spanish colonies in
                                    what is now independent Latin America, they all managed to break away from Spain and
                                    become independent countries. Ruler after ruler, many of them who had been military
                                    men who had seized power, deliberately styled themselves after Napoleon. And if you
                                    were to go to Latin America today, you would find the first name Napoleon very
                                    commonly given to young boys.

                                <p>
                                    Kate, what are your thoughts on this idea of Napoleon's legacy for leadership? I
                                    teach Napoleon as a case study on a leadership module. Napoleon offers this great
                                    example of the charismatic leader on the one hand, and yet also someone who's
                                    extremely good at organizing systems. He allows us to think about why leadership
                                    fails, because in many ways he's remembered as much for the battle that he loses at
                                    Waterloo as he is for all of his victories. But from what you're saying, he's also a
                                    model for why leadership can succeed, but why it might then subsequently fail. The
                                    leadership life cycle where you need to adapt your leadership style according to
                                    where you are in your trajectory fits very neatly onto Napoleon's career. Nobody
                                    wants to become an elderly Elvis. Napoleon was the international celebrity of his
                                    age, let's face it. And he inspired films, poems, songs, and plays. The British
                                    historian Andrew Roberts claims that more books have been written with Napoleon in
                                    the title than there have been days since his death in 1821. And yet, in spite of
                                    all that, certain myths about him persist.

                                <p>
                                    So to finish, I just wanted to ask all three of you, which is the myth about
                                    Napoleon that you'd most like to see dispelled?

                                </p>
                                <p>



                                    Annie? He was not small, but not tall either. He seemed small because his marshals
                                    were very tall.

                                    Kate? The myth I'd like to dispel most, I think, is the idea that he stifles artists
                                    and writers and playwrights. But actually, I think that's as much to do with a myth
                                    that the romantics create about their work in the 1820s, that they put down any of
                                    the aesthetic innovations, particularly in theatre, so that they can stress their
                                    own novelty. So I think it's a question of looking again at the way in which power
                                    and culture are intertwined and how actually aesthetic innovations do take place
                                    during the Napoleonic period.

                                    Rafe? The greatest myth for me about Napoleon is the idea that his true genius lay
                                    on the battlefield. But overall, all of his military gains were soon swept away
                                    andnone of that lasts today. But we have many, many of his civil and political
                                    achievements as head of the French state that have. Any of his civil and political
                                    achievements as head of the French state that have persisted down to the present
                                    day.

                                    BBC Sounds, music, radio, podcasts. It was Karl Marx who has done more to alter the
                                    world, I say for ill. It's 1974 and a man is standing in front of a room full of
                                    students. The room is small but packed out. How did he have the time to write his
                                    work? Some of them are laughing at him, some heckling. The speaker is tall, slightly
                                    disheveled, eyes darting around the room, looking out of place in his suit and tie,
                                    hectoring an audience who are goading him on. It was Karl Marx who had more effect
                                    on the world. He's out of place, but he's on fire. On fire with his determination
                                    that things must change or all will be lost. His name is Keith Joseph. And he's a
                                    senior Conservative politician. But he's also known by another name. What was the
                                    nickname of the barrister and Conservative Cabinet Minister Sir Keith Joseph? The
                                    Conservatives' Rasputin. Surely known during the late 1970s and 1980s as the Mad
                                    Monk. He was called the Mad Monk. Mad Monk, the Mad Monk is correct. And this Mad
                                    Monk was on a mission. A mission to transform the country's hearts and minds. For 30
                                    years, Keith Joseph believes, the socialists have made the running in British
                                    politics. To convince Britain that for the past 30 years, every government, both
                                    Tory and Labour, had got it wrong. So Sir Keith is on the warpath, goading his
                                    opponents to join the battle of ideas. It was a mission that would transform
                                    politics and Britain forever.

                                    I stand before you tonight in my red star chiffon evening gown. The Iron Lady of the
                                    Western world. I'm David Dimbleby and from the History Podcast and BBC Radio 4, this
                                    is Invisible Hands. The story of the free market revolution. A hidden force that
                                    changed Britain forever and the invisible hands that shaped it. Episode 2, The Mad
                                    Monk.

                                    We ended the last episode with that chicken farmer, Anthony Fisher. He had set up a
                                    radical think tank called the Institute of Economic Affairs. And he was working away
                                    in the background trying to convince Britain's movers and shakers that the free
                                    market was the answer. But the problem for Fisher was that in the decades following
                                    World War II, his ideas were way outside the mainstream. He was battling against the
                                    current. Because whether it was a Labour Prime Minister...

                                </p>
                                <p>



                                    We believe that it is central to maintain the economic controls necessary.
                                </p>
                                <p>


                                    Or whether it was a Tory one...

                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    We have built our defence against want and sickness and we're proud of it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    They basically both agreed. Government's job was to steer the nation's economy and
                                    to protect the welfare of the people. This was the post-war consensus. And Fisher's
                                    ideas were out in the cold. But in the early 1970s, this model was showing signs of
                                    weakness. For one thing, inflation kept rising. Strikes began to have a serious
                                    impact on people's lives. Certainly there was no love lost between the post office
                                    and the postal workers' union while services were suspended during the strike. Post
                                    offices were shut and pillar boxes sealed. The miners were threatening to walk out.
                                    Unemployment hit one million. It was clear something was badly wrong, but neither
                                    party, Labour or Conservative, seemed to have a way of putting things right.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And then in 1973, things really started to unravel. The government have declared a
                                    state of emergency because of the threat to oil supplies from the Middle East
                                    situation. War in the Middle East. The garage decided to start its own petrol
                                    rationing when it received a letter from its suppliers warning that the situation
                                    had seriously affected the company's supply of crude oil and petroleum products. Oil
                                    prices skyrocketed. People started queuing at petrol stations. Motorists filling
                                    their tanks before the supplies ran out.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Good evening. It's really been one of those weeks, hasn't it? I was working on the
                                    BBC's Nationwide at the time. It was an early evening magazine programme that went
                                    out after the news every night. As always, everyone's been blaming everybody else
                                    for what's happened. The government have blamed the motorist for causing a panic run
                                    on petrol. Motorists have been attacking the garages. Some of the garages have been
                                    attacking the oil companies. And this petrol shortage was the only thing people were
                                    talking about. The soaring price of oil meant the government now had to rely on coal
                                    to provide electric power. So the miners chose this moment to ramp up their threats
                                    and demand more money. And the government took extreme measures in response.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The government has ordered severe cuts in electricity for industry and commerce. For
                                    many workers, it will mean a three-day week and less pay. The country was plunged
                                    into darkness. Whilst we celebrated the start of another year, the lights were going
                                    out all over Britain. And the government gave advice about how to cope:

                                </p>
                                <p>



                                    You don't need to do your teeth with the light on.

                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    You can do it in the dark.

                                    Ordinary life was completely disrupted. It was almost like being back in the war. I
                                    mean, I remember streets in darkness, shop fronts with their lights switched off,
                                    the cinemas were closed, theatres apparently working by candlelight. I can't think
                                    of anything in my lifetime that resembled it, except perhaps the restrictions
                                    imposed after Covid.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I want to speak to you simply and plainly about the grave emergency now facing our
                                    country. We shall have a harder Christmas than we have known since the war. There
                                    was a headline in the American Wall Street Journal that summer which read, "Goodbye
                                    Great Britain, it was nice knowing you." We had become a laughingstock on the world
                                    stage.

                                    In 1974, I began presenting Panorama. Panorama, certainly the flagship of BBC
                                    Current Affairs television programmes, celebrated its 21st birthday this week with a
                                    new presenter, David Dimbleby. And in programme after programme, we debated the
                                    serious issues facing Britain. I think if we're going to get to the root of this
                                    30-year decline, you mustn't be frightened of a bit of discussion. Successive
                                    governments seemed to have run out of options. We do face what is generally agreed
                                    to be a very grave economic crisis.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    People came on the programme with all kinds of different ideas of what to do. In
                                    tonight's programme, we'll be examining the government's plans for regenerating
                                    British industry by a massive extension of public investment and ownership. There
                                    were even wild suggestions that what the country really needed was a military
                                    takeover, a coup.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I believe that all the leaders in Parliament are tending to ignore the threat to the
                                    Constitution, and I believe it is time for good men to stand up and do something
                                    about it. It's hard to believe, but people were completely serious about it. This
                                    polarisation in society, I think, might lead to a situation of authoritarian
                                    government which would use military force to maintain its position and keep its
                                    power.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The question is, what can we do now to stop the lights of civilisation going out
                                    altogether? The point is, at the time, everyone was asking, what are we going to do?
                                    But no one seemed to have an answer.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Then one day we invited onto the programme someone rather eccentric. He had wild
                                    curly hair. He sometimes sweated as he spoke. And his eyes were always off to one
                                    side, scanning the room. His name was Keith Joseph. And a few months before, he'd
                                    been in the Conservative Cabinet, but in spite of that, he seemed to lack
                                    confidence. He was so nervous, we didn't actually dare to bring him into the tense
                                    atmosphere of the studio and decided instead to talk to him at a place where he'd
                                    feel at home: his Oxford College, All Souls. But even that wasn't enough to calm him
                                    down. The driver who brought him to Oxford afterwards told me that on the journey,
                                    Joseph had asked him to stop the car so that he could be sick on the verge.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Keith Joseph was nervous because this interview was really important to him. He was
                                    a man on a mission, and he was about to make his argument on Panorama with a huge
                                    audience, an argument that would shake the foundations of the British political
                                    system. He wanted to tell the country that there was only one way of solving
                                    Britain's problems, and that was to get government off people's backs. Every time
                                    the government takes a decision, it takes away the power of decision from the
                                    people, and we've gone too far along that road.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Keith's argument was astonishing because it was coming from someone who most people
                                    knew as a rather conventionalpolitician, someone who was very much a believer in the
                                    post-war consensus. The only answer is more houses. Minister for Housing in the
                                    1960s. Reaching and maintaining a level of 400,000 houses a year. In charge of one
                                    of the biggest house building programs in British history. He believed in using the
                                    power of government for good. We have to spread the resources through all the needs.
                                    That is the slums, the homeless, and those who want to own homes of their own as
                                    well.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But over time, Joseph began to have doubts. He took a close look at the government
                                    that he was serving. At the trade unions, which seemed to be more and more powerful.
                                    At taxation, which was always high. And he started to think that maybe the country
                                    had got it wrong.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Then one day, he was sitting on the beach with his children on a summer holiday,
                                    reading the newspaper, when an article caught his eye with the catchy little title,
                                    "The Subsidized Road to Good Intentions." Joseph devoured it. The author was
                                    connected to something called the Institute of Economic Affairs. Yes, that Institute
                                    of Economic Affairs. The one started by our chicken farmer, Anthony Fisher. Joseph
                                    was intrigued. He began reading their many pamphlets, even going to their lectures,
                                    and slowly but surely, his mind was being changed.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And by the mid-1970s, when we made the film about him for Panorama, he was a fully
                                    paid-up member of Fisher's cult. And he wanted to tell the world about his damascene
                                    conversion.
                                </p>
                                <p>


                                    I thought I was a conservative, but all the time I was in favour of shortcuts to
                                    utopia. I was in favour of the government doing things because I was so impatient
                                    for good things to be done.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To loudly proclaim that everything he had believed in his entire life, his whole
                                    career, was wrong.

                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    I didn't realise that the government generally makes a mess. The government is
                                    overwhelmed. It's trying to do far too much and it's doing it very badly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And his solution?

                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    And now I realise that we've got to try to hand back more decisions to the people.
                                    We've got to trust the people.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And for him, that meant taking decision-making power from government and giving it
                                    to the market. Free people making a free choice about what they wanted.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I put it to him that it was, to put it mildly, a pretty surprising thing for a
                                    senior Tory politician to be saying.

                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    Isn't there a real danger that the public hearing you say this will say to
                                    themselves, it is incredible that a party can go the way it's gone, ask for our vote
                                    for 30 years, and then suddenly a conversion to something so radically different
                                    that it represents a really entirely different kind of policy, and we don't actually
                                    find it credible. Do you not think that the public recognises that some things with
                                    the best of intentions haven't gone awfully well?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At the end of that interview, there was no doubt in my mind how committed he was.

                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    The facts are on our side. We need to wage and win the battle of ideas.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But what was Joseph going to do? He decided that the best thing was to go around
                                    speaking to anyone who'd listen to him. To working men's clubs, debating societies,
                                    anywhere that would have him. Every day of the week before university and
                                    polytechnic audiences like this, as well as gatherings of the party faithful, Sir
                                    Keith wages his intellectual offensive.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As we heard at the beginning, he'd stand at the front of lecture halls where posters
                                    were showing Marx and Che Guevara, and he'd tell the young idealists that what they
                                    were fighting for was wrong.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    What Britain needed was not more but less interference by the state. It amounts to a
                                    restated Tory creed, different from the voice we've been accustomed to hear from the
                                    Conservative Party. More aggressive, more clearly defined, and not at all apologetic
                                    about the more controversial articles of the faith.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    He called it his campaign for capitalism, and he met fierce opposition. He was
                                    heckled. He was boycotted. One time, he was even physically attacked. He was
                                    agonised and passionate. There was this kind of vein on his temple that was
                                    throbbing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That's David Willetts. He'd later become one of Britain's most ardent free
                                    marketeers, but in the early 1970s, he was a student who'd just arrived at Oxford
                                    University.
                                </p>

                                    And I've been interested in socialism. There was a time, as I recall, when I got the
                                    Morning Star and used to read the Morning Star in my youthful teens. The Morning
                                    Star was a paper partly funded by Moscow,by the Soviet Union itself. I did think,
                                    well, communism must be the obvious thing. What's the point of anybody having a
                                    different income from anyone else? David Willits didn't quite see himself as a
                                    communist, but he was searching for a solution to Britain's problems.
                                </p>

                                    And then one day he went to a talk at the Students' Union, as he often did. The
                                    speaker was this middle-aged Tory politician. It was, of course, Keith Joseph. He
                                    seemed almost haunted by kind of what had gone wrong, had he had a role in what had
                                    gone wrong. And he was really appealing to us as a younger generation, as the next
                                    generation, not to make the mistakes he had made. David was intrigued and he started
                                    exploring these ideas, and inevitably one place he went to was a radical think tank.

                                    I became a subscriber to the Institute of Economic Affairs. I started getting their
                                    pamphlets, ripped the covers off with excitement when they arrived. Soon David's
                                    morning star days were over. Now he was reading articles which dealt with things
                                    like:


                                </p>
                                <p>


                                    Why planning controls were stopping us building houses,

                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    Why the control of prices in some industry or other was doing damage,

                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    Why the monopoly in air transport was a bad thing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Probably not what most young people in the 70s were reading, but to David these were
                                    exciting ideas. Ideas that had the potential to change the world.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And David started following Keith Joseph. He was as intellectually serious as the
                                    papers and books I was reading, and he was also active in politics. He had real
                                    power and he wanted to use political power to deliver some of these ideas. And so by
                                    the time David left Oxford, he had decided he'd go into politics, follow Keith
                                    Joseph's vision, and change the country.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I was definitely, when I left, a free marketeer. And I didn't believe that just as a
                                    piece of economic theory. I also thought it was a better society with greater
                                    freedom. So Keith Joseph was clearly winning over some hearts and minds, but he had
                                    to do something else. Something far more difficult. He had to win over his party.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Because in the mid-1970s, many Conservatives were sceptical of Joseph's free market
                                    vision, just like he used to be. But Joseph was determined to change that, so he did
                                    what any good politician would do.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I became aware that he was starting a think tank. That's Bernard Donoghue. Bernard
                                    was Keith Joseph's ideological counterpart on the opposite side. He worked for the
                                    Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson, and in 1974 he set up the Number 10 Policy
                                    Unit, and his job was to support the government, defend the post-war status quo,
                                    make it work, and find out what the Tories were up to.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I was a bit of a spy. That's how I got my information. I was brought up on you,
                                    crossed those margins, and you dealt with all the serious political people, even if
                                    they were on the other side. And the enemy on the other side Bernard was most
                                    interested in was Keith Joseph.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I mean, some people found they couldn't talk to him because he didn't necessarily
                                    listen to what they said. He would tell them something else, mainly of supporting
                                    the free market economy. Sometimes, in a discussion, he would suddenly wave his arms
                                    all around and start to babble. Keith Joseph was single-minded, obsessive, totally
                                    devoted to one thing: free market capitalism.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And then in October 1974, he spotted his opportunity. The Tory leader, Edward Heath,
                                    was standing down after losing two elections to Labour in a single year, and Joseph
                                    thought this could be his moment. And he prepared to run for the leadership of the
                                    Conservative Party and, of course, to win it round to his radical ideas.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    He talked to the press, he lobbied his colleagues, trying to build up enough support
                                    to win the leadership. It was all going well until he made a fatal error. In October
                                    1974, he gives a speech in Birmingham to Conservative Party members, and he'd
                                    arranged to talk about something close to his heart and to the hearts of the
                                    gathered party members. That was family values.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And that's when he says something that's truly shocking, something nobody saw
                                    coming. He says, toomany children nowadays are being born to women with little
                                    education, and the balance of our population, our human stock, is threatened. What
                                    he seemed to be saying is that the poor were breeding too much. It had the
                                    disconcerting ring of eugenics. Inevitably, the next morning, the press were camped
                                    on his doorstep. Are you advocating any form of compulsory birth control? It sounds
                                    inconceivable, literally inconceivable, of course not. He claimed he was
                                    misrepresented, but then he seemed to make things worse. And it is just emotional
                                    security that these one-parent households from this group are least able to give.
                                    Again and again. I have no regrets for what I said, because it is true. His
                                    leadership hopes were now in ruins, and he must have wondered whether his crusade to
                                    turn the country around was dead. But luckily, there was someone waiting in the
                                    wings who could take his place. Someone who'd been inspired by him and mentored by
                                    him. When he became convinced, finally convinced, that a proposition was correct, he
                                    felt he had to defend it. When he faced those raging, spitting Trotskyite crowds at
                                    our great liberal centres of learning, I suspect he wondered sometimes whether he
                                    would have to die for it.

                                    Margaret Thatcher. We were always going to get to her. Bernard Donoghue remembers
                                    meeting her for the first time, a decade earlier in 1964. An October evening,
                                    absolutely pouring down. We sat there waiting. And then suddenly the doors flew
                                    open, and in through the door, taking off her soaking wet raincoat, came this quite
                                    smart lady. She rolled her wet raincoat up, and without looking back, she threw it
                                    over her shoulder, without looking. And one of the men behind her caught it. He was
                                    immediately impressed. She was always very sharp, almost aggressive at times. But
                                    Donoghue says what she didn't have at the time was a clear political agenda. And I
                                    saw the change over the years, that in 64 she was full of this sharpness, but she
                                    didn't have many particular policies. That was until she started sitting at the feet
                                    of the mad monk. She would refer to her guru, Keith Joseph. She became his disciple.
                                    He told me he felt she had got all the right instincts, but not much knowledge. And
                                    so he set about training her, Yoda to Thatcher's Luke Skywalker. He taught her about
                                    how to cut spending and about the case for a leaner state. He gave her pamphlets to
                                    read and books.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The view which became an orthodoxy in the early part of this century was that the
                                    story of human progress in the modern world was the story of increasing state power.
                                    It was in revolt against this trend that Hayek wrote The Road to Serpent, which had
                                    such a great effect upon me when I first read it, and a greater effect still when
                                    Keith suggested that I go deeper into Hayek's other writings. Soon Margaret Thatcher
                                    was singing from the Keith Joseph hymn book. We would make private enterprise
                                    worthwhile. Profit would no longer be a dirty word. So when Keith's campaign
                                    collapsed, he knew who to turn to. She was a far better communicator and she had the
                                    common touch.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We'll bring in a society which lives within its means, where public expenditure is
                                    cut and where waste of taxpayers' money is ruthlessly expunged. Yes, we'll bring in
                                    a conservative society. The leadership baton had been passed, but that of course
                                    didn't guarantee that Thatcher would be the next Prime Minister. She was still way
                                    out of the political mainstream. And for a time, it seemed as though the Labour
                                    government was doingall right. They'd made a deal with the unions. Maybe the crisis
                                    was averted. But then came the winter of 1970. But then came the winter of 1979.
                                    With the worst weather conditions for over 30 years, it looked the proverbial winter
                                    of discontent. Inflation at 10%, the government offering workers only a 5% pay rise.
                                    And one by one, the unions go on strike. In a power struggle that's plunged the
                                    country into its toughest crisis since the general strike of 1926 and plagued the
                                    daily life of every sector of the population. And this time it did truly feel as
                                    though the country and the government was at breaking point. And bodies are
                                    literally piling up. In Liverpool alone, 300 have been stored, possibly for a mass
                                    emergency burial at sea.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This time it's been a short, sharp strike, but it's already had a knock-on effect.
                                    There are empty beds up on Bland Sutton Ward because the hospital stopped all but
                                    emergency admissions last Thursday. All these dreadful people holding us to ransom,
                                    we were the laughingstock of the world. The post-war consensus was dead. People were
                                    ready for change.

                                    And on a bright spring day in May 1979... Good evening, we'll be on the air here
                                    with Decision 79 until 4 o'clock. I stayed up all night covering every tense moment.
                                    That scoreboard behind me, which at the moment shows nothing, will be giving us some
                                    clue as to who is to form the next government of Britain. And Bernard Donoghue was
                                    watching from inside Number 10. It was very clear early on, the first few results,
                                    that Mrs Thatcher was going to win. Waving there, coming out from the smut. New suit
                                    at Flood Street. We recognise Flood Street by the cherry blossom. And then I walked
                                    out of the back of Number 10. I had to stop to let pass a little convoy of Mrs
                                    Thatcher turning down Whitehall. I gave a wave, and that was the start of the new
                                    transformation.

                                    Keith Joseph, certainly one of the most interesting politicians I'd ever met, and to
                                    many people one of the weirdest, had in the space of just five years broken the
                                    post-war consensus. He'd changed the minds of students, of politicians, and
                                    eventually of the country. His disciple was now in power. Her Majesty the Queen has
                                    asked me to form a new administration, and I have accepted. It is, of course, the
                                    greatest honour that can come to any citizen in a democracy. There is now work to be
                                    done.

                                    But would Keith Joseph's free market revolution actually work? There was no great
                                    automatic enthusiasm. Lots of people said, look, it's absurd. That's next time.

                                Winston Churchill (1874â€“1965) was a British statesman, orator, and writer who led the
                                United
                                Kingdom through its darkest hour during World War II. Known for his unwavering resolve
                                and
                                stirring speeches, Churchill became a symbol of resistance against Nazi tyranny.

                            <p>
                                Born into an aristocratic family, Churchill had a varied career as a soldier,
                                journalist,
                                and politician before becoming Prime Minister in 1940. His leadership during the war,
                                particularly during the Battle of Britain, inspired the nation with famous speeches like
                                "We
                                shall fight on the beaches" and "Their finest hour."</p>

                            <p>
                                Despite losing the 1945 election after the war, Churchill remained influential, warning
                                of
                                the Cold Warâ€™s dangers and promoting European unity. A prolific writer, he won the Nobel

                            <p> Remembered as one of historyâ€™s greatest leaders, Churchillâ€™s legacy endures as a

                                to courage, determination, and the power of words in times of crisis.

                            <p>
                                Good evening. My name is Herbert Marshall. I am, as some of you will know, an actor. A
                                player of parts, a meddler, if you will, in other people's dreams. Upon request, those
                                of my
                                craft can summon up a tragedy or a comedy, weep over ancient wrongs, make fantasy real
                                and
                                reality a thing as formidable as the mists that roll in come midnight over the coast of
                                Britain.</p>
                            <p>

                                But tonight I come on a different errand. The dreams I meddle with are my own and yours.
                                For
                                herewith is the story of a man who yet walks among us, whose words you have heard, whose
                                decisions for better or for worse have molded our lives and the ways of generations yet
                                unborn. Next Tuesday, he will be 80 years old.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But listen. I am, as I am reminded, an old man. It is true that all that ailed me in my
                                youth have been accomplished. I have no personal advantage to gain by undertaking once
                                more
                                the hard and grim duty of leading Britain and our empire. But while God gives me the
                                strength and the people show me their goodwill, it is my duty to try. And try I will.
                                Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill. Still for him the tumult and the shouting, the
                                captain to
                                the king.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But for us on this birthday eve, time for a looking back. Time to walk again the paths
                                we
                                walked together in less quiet days. Here, in Sir Winston's own incomparable words, is
                                the
                                story of our times. The pride and the shame, the glory and the pain of it. The tumult
                                and
                                the shouting.

                                birthday next Tuesday. This is Ben Brower speaking. In the next 55 minutes or so, we
                                shall
                                bring back the voice of Sir Winston Churchill, a voice caught in its most dramatic
                                moments
                                and held against the years.

                                We shall hear the French Premier when alien boots tramped the streets of Paris. We shall
                                hear Salon to Olivier, Sir Ralph Richardson, Lynn Fontaine and a host of ladies and
                                gentlemen who, each in his own fashion, wishes to say happy birthday.

                                You know, this is an era of spectacular progress, particularly in bringing the good
                                things
                                of life to more and more people. Three important economic measurements of how well we
                                live
                                are these:





                                The abundance of food and fiber we produce.



                                Our production and use of electrical energy.



                                A construction program to match our growing population.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Alice Chalmers seeks to contribute to better living by building key machines necessary
                                for
                                progress in each of these three fields. Consider the need for more construction.
                                Population
                                totals in the United States and Canada are increasing by more than 50,000 every week,
                                almost
                                the equivalent of two new cities the size of Philadelphia and Ottawa every year. To
                                house
                                these new citizens, our two countries are building new homes at a rate of more than a
                                million yearly.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Consider also that new motor vehicles are going into use at more than double the rate of
                                street and highway construction. That is why each of our countries is giving increased
                                attention to road improvement, with a new $100 billion program under study in the United
                                States.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Alice Chalmers builds many of the key machines necessary to such progress: crawler
                                tractors,
                                motor scrapers, motor graders, and engines for earth moving, logging, mining, and pipe
                                laying. Crushers, screens, cement plants, and equipment to help mines and quarries turn
                                outthe raw materials of construction. Yes, construction is one of the measuring sticks
                                of

                                And now, here to guide us on our story of Sir Winston Churchill, is one of the most
                                distinguished gentlemen of the American and British theater, Mr. Herbert Marshall.

                                How do you take the measure of a man? We have learned to gauge a mountain's height, to
                                trace
                                the contours of the ocean floor. We can triangulate the miles that stretch from here to
                                the
                                nearest star. But man, this most multitudinous and familiar of creatures, here is
                                mystery.
                                Young Churchill must have been a mystery to one of his schoolmasters, for example, who
                                remembered him only as a somewhat reluctant student who had difficulty pronouncing the
                                letter S. He was born in a rambling old castle, nourished in plenty, molded by
                                traditions
                                older even than his name. In short, had every opportunity to develop into a typical
                                landed
                                English gentleman, respected and honored by his family, and totally unknown beyond the
                                narrow parish wherein he conducted his affairs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But fame is a jealous mistress, and whoso would win her favors knows many a rocky road
                                and
                                many a sleepless night. There was war in India, and he had learned the color of blood at
                                a
                                time when most of his fellow students at Sandhurst were still wrestling with the book of
                                regulations. There was a bigger war in France in which he took a bigger part, first Lord
                                of
                                the Admiralty, then the first of many setbacks, demoted and again a frontline officer.
                                But
                                even then, those who listened knew that a very special man had come among them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Let me ask you this. What subtle, almost mystic pattern defied thousands of miles across
                                South Africa? All the world listens. Bludgeon great races, the Czechs, the Poles, the
                                Norwegians, the Danes, the Dutch, the Belgians, upon all of whom the long night of
                                barbarism
                                will descend, unbroken even by a star of hope, unless we conquer, and conquer we must,
                                as
                                conquer we shall.

                                Prime Minister Winston Churchill, called back in his hour of trial, and the story that
                                was
                                over has just begun. Winston Churchill, this man with a face like Mr. Pickwick and a
                                voice
                                like a swashbuckling Elizabethan. Winston Churchill, a name to conjure with, a man to
                                stand
                                against the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune and throw his defiance against the
                                storm.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The night he became Prime Minister, May the 10th, it was, 1940, a British destroyer
                                slipped
                                out of the harbor at Southampton for patrol duty along the channel. Another ship was
                                coming
                                in. In a matter of seconds, the signal was flashed from the first ship to the second,
                                Winnie
                                is back. And across the dark waters of the bay, there came the echo of cheering as the
                                message was passed from mouth to mouth, Winnie is back.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Tell it to the young mother struggling to fit a gas mask on her youngest and
                                uncomprehending
                                son. Tell it to the soldiers poised across the channel to give aid to the retreating
                                French.
                                The English channel, since time out of mind, a moat of this fortress island, a road to
                                less
                                happier lands, a wall that divides Britain from the world.

                                The sea is calm tonight, the tide is full, the moonlight fair upon the straits. On the
                                French coast, the light gleams and is gone. The cliffs of England stand glimmering and
                                vast
                                out in the tranquil bay. Come to the window, sweet is the night air. Only from the long
                                line
                                of spray where the sea meets the moon-blanched land, listen, you hear the grating roar
                                of
                                pebbles which the waves draw back and fling at their return of the highest land, begin
                                and
                                cease and then again begin with tremulous cadence slow and bring the eternal note of
                                sadness
                                in.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sophocles long ago heard it on the Aegean and it brought intohis mind the turbid ebb and
                                flow of human misery. We find also in the sound a thought, hearing it by this distant
                                northern sea. The Sea of Faith was once too at the full, and round Earth's shore lay
                                like
                                the folds of a bright girdle fur. But now I only hear its melancholy long withdrawing
                                roar,
                                retreating to the breath of a night wind down the vast edges drear and naked shingles of
                                the
                                world.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our love, let us be true to one another. For the world which seems to lie before us like
                                a
                                land of dreams, so various, so beautiful, so new, has really neither joy nor love nor
                                light,
                                nor certitude nor peace, nor help nor pain. And we are here as on a darkling plain,
                                swept
                                with confused alarms of struggle and flight, where ignorant armies clash by night.

                                They managed to sing, some of them, God knows how, of their retreat. Long lines crowding
                                down on the beach at Dunkirk, whole regiments missing, half their equipment lining the
                                road
                                that stretched back to the channel. The enemy had been too strong, too fast. That they
                                came
                                from the battle not in disorder as frightened men come, but in weariness and thickened
                                heart
                                of men who had been asked to do too much.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dunkirk. A small French town perched on the rim of the waves that gave it birth. Stand
                                where
                                you are, you with the weariness in your eyes. Rest a moment, you too young to learn what
                                you
                                have learned these last few days. Look to the sea. Over the rim of the horizon a miracle
                                is
                                in the making. A hastily assembled fleet, fishing craft most of them, occasional are the
                                trim lines of a pleasure craft, an icebox fashioned for champagne now holding plasma.
                                And so
                                they came back.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In Berlin, Hitler smiled and clapped his hands like a child. Britain, that most
                                formidable
                                of enemies, had been engaged and beaten. Beaten? Not quite. It's June the 19th, 1940.
                                The
                                hospitals are crowded with men who returned. Even as we speak, the Luftwaffe is
                                gathering
                                for the first blow.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But now, Mr. Prime Minister, I do not at all underrate the severity of the ordeal which
                                lies
                                before us. For all of us, whatever our sphere or station, it will be a help to think of
                                the
                                famous lines:





                                In nothing common did or mean upon that memorable scene.

                            </p>
                            <p>

                                Aye, more, freedom shall be restored to all.



                                We abate nothing of our dust demands.



                                Not one jot or tittle do we receive.



                                The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us.



                                Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this island or lose the war.



                                If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be freed and the life of the world may move
                                forward into broad, sunlit uplands.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties. So bear ourselves that if the British
                                Empire
                                and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, this was their
                                finest
                                hour. And in this hour, Britain stood alone.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Each night was a repetition of the last. Each dawn saw the enemy hasten away like some
                                evil
                                creature who walks only at night. Fire licking at the majestic dome of St. Paul's, bombs
                                falling on the slums of Whitechapel and Spitalfields as though to compound the misery
                                already there. Bombs in the palace yard and a king who stands unmoved at the crash of
                                glass
                                or the splintering of wood.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These sounds would echo across the world, would be heard of the huge rambling old house
                                that
                                sits back from the street at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington,D.C. No matter how
                                many
                                doors were closed against it, the sound came through. You could hear it in Dubuque. You
                                could hear it in Dubuque. Cleveland and Medicine Hat. Bombs and the sound of marching
                                feet.
                                They rang down every street. The echo beat against your door.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                President Lincoln said in 1862,



                                Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this administration
                                will
                                be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance or insignificance can
                                spare
                                one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us in honor or
                                dishonor to the latest generation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And so what Mr. Churchill was to call the Grand Alliance began to take form. June 22nd,
                                1941, and a world grown familiar with the unbelievable heard a piece of news that
                                strained
                                all credulity. In the early hours of the morning, Adolf Hitler had invaded Russia. Like
                                Napoleon before him, he sent his legions swarming into the plains that stretch out
                                beyond
                                the Neiman River. Like Napoleon, he spoke contemptuously of the Russian winter, the long
                                nights, the wind that sweeps down out of Siberia like the stab of a sword.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once again in Downing Street, time for decision. At four o'clock this morning, Hitler
                                attacked and invaded Russia. No one has been a more consistent opponent of communism
                                than I
                                have for the last 25 years. I will unsay no word that I've spoken about it. But all this
                                fades away before the spectacle which is now unfolding. The past with its crimes, its
                                follies, and its tragedies flashes away. Any man or state who fights against Nazism will
                                have our aid. Any man or state who marches with Hitler is our foe. That is our policy
                                and
                                that is our declaration. It follows, therefore, that we shall give whatever help we can
                                to
                                Russia and to the Russian people.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is not given to the living to see the future. Hitler could not divine the Battle of
                                Stalingrad, nor could the powers of the West foresee with clarity the twisting tortured
                                way
                                that lay out of Stalingrad. But to the West, a star of hope for all free men.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Two months after the invasion of Russia, a British ship of war anchored somewhere off
                                the
                                coast of Newfoundland. The sun turned the wind-lashed sea into a carpet of sparkling
                                jewels.
                                President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill met on the huge quarterdeck and talked
                                like
                                the old friends they were. And from their talks was forged the Atlantic Charter, a map
                                for
                                the path to freedom, a compact for the future.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sunday morning found them with their work done. And in the manner of their fathers, they
                                found time to give thanks that Sunday morning. Roosevelt sitting there in that old cape
                                he
                                loved so well. The Prime Minister next to him smiling as they and the crew joined in
                                singing
                                Onward Christian Soldiers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We had a church parade on the Sunday in our Atlantic Bay. The President came onto the
                                quarterdeck of the Prince of Wales where there were mingled together many hundreds of
                                American and British sailors and marines. The sun shone bright and warm while we all
                                sang
                                the old hymns which are our common inheritance and which we learned as children in our
                                homes. When I looked upon that densely packed congregation, it swept across me that here
                                ran
                                the only hope, but also the sure hope of saving the world from measureless degradation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And so we came back across the ocean wave,uplifted in spirit, fortified in resolve. And
                                then
                                I felt that hard and terrible and long drawn out as this struggle may be. We shall not
                                be
                                denied the strength to do our duty to the end.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And so the bones were forged, ties the more subtle for being unseen, a friendship
                                stronger
                                because of the test that must admit. Capitol Hill in Washington, Congress in convention
                                assembled stands in tribute to the man who walks slowly to the speaker's stand. Senate,
                                House of Representatives, these are not part of the vocabulary of government as he has
                                learned it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But this man is no stranger to any assembly where English is the language spoken. I
                                cannot
                                help but reflecting that if my father had been American and my mother British instead of
                                the
                                other way around, I might have got here on my own. In that case, this would not have
                                been
                                the first time you would have heard my voice. In that case, I should not have needed any
                                invitation. But if I had, it is hardly likely that it would have been unanimous. So
                                perhaps
                                things are better as they are.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One final word before he returns to his bomb-wrecked homeland. It is December the 24th,
                                1941, that most somber Christmas Eve. A tree has been lighted on the White House lawn,
                                an
                                act of defiance almost on that day. A desperate attempt at make-believe, a way of
                                telling
                                yourself and your neighbor that this Christmas will be just like all other Christmases
                                when
                                we all knew it would not.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The president has spoken to the group who came down to watch the ceremony. And now,
                                would
                                the Prime Minister say a few words?

                                Fellows, soldiers, in the cause, this is a strange Christmas Eve. Almost the whole world
                                is
                                locked in deadly struggle, armed with the most terrible weapons which science can
                                devise.
                                The nations advance upon each other. Ill would it be for us this Christmastide if we
                                were
                                not sure that no greed for the lands of wealth of any other people, no vulgar ambition,
                                no
                                morbid lust for material gain at the expense of others, had led us to the field. Ill
                                would
                                it be for us if that were so.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Here in the midst of war raging and roaring over all the lands and seas, creeping nearer
                                to
                                our hearts and homes. Here amid all these tumult, we have tonight the peace of the
                                spirit in
                                each cottage home and in every generous heart. Therefore, we may cast aside, for this
                                night
                                at least, the cares and dangers which beset us and make for the children an evening of
                                happiness in a world of storms.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Here then, for one night only, each home throughout the English-speaking world should be
                                a
                                brightly lighted island of happiness and peace. Let the children have their night of fun
                                and
                                laughter. Let the gift of Father Christmas delight their play. Let us grown-ups share to
                                the
                                full in their unstinted pleasures before we turn again to the stern task and
                                formidableyear
                                that lie before us. Resolved that by our sacrifice and daring, these same children shall
                                not
                                be robbed of their inheritance or denied their right to live in a free and decent world.
                                And
                                so, in God's mercy, a happy Christmas to you all.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We are midway in our 80th birthday tribute to Sir Winston Churchill. We continue after a
                                brief pause for station identification. Again, here is Herbert Marshall.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the fullness of time, the final scene was played. It came suddenly, it seemed, to
                                many of
                                us. All at once there were Allied soldiers at the gates of Berlin, Hitler dead by his
                                own
                                hand. The German divisions that once seemed invincible were fleeing down roads that just
                                four years before they had marched in arrogance and victory. Traffic was stopped in
                                Trafalgar Square. It was the same in Times Square, in Melbourne, Toronto, in Atlanta and
                                Oslo, and as before, this voice above all others.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The German war is therefore at an end. We may allow ourselves a brief period of
                                rejoicing.
                                But let us not forget for a moment the toils and efforts that lie ahead.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Advance Britannia! Long live the cause of freedom!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This royal throne of kings, this sceptered isle, this earth of majesty, this seat of
                                Mars,
                                this other Eden, demi-paradise, this fortress built by nature for herself against
                                infection
                                and the hand of war, this happy breed of men, this little world, this precious stone set
                                in
                                the silver sea, which served it in the office of a wall or as a moat defensive to a
                                house
                                against the envy of less happier lands, this blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this
                                kingdom.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And so we are come to wish a happy birthday to the Prime Minister. We who owe him much
                                offer
                                what words we can as a part payment, if you will, for services rendered. In so doing, we
                                take our place among a distinguished company.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We are pleased to present the Canadian Prime Minister, the Honourable Louis San Laurent.
                                Canada is delighted to join in the birthday salute to Sir Winston Churchill and I am
                                greatly
                                honoured to have been asked to be the spokesman for my 15 million fellow Canadians. In
                                this
                                country we recall with heartfelt admiration and gratitude the peerless leadership he
                                gave to
                                us all in the grim days of the war when the Commonwealth unaided was fighting the forces
                                of
                                evil. Sir Winston in those days had become far more than the Prime Ministerof any one
                                country. For all of us, his voice was the voice of human freedom, and he represented the
                                symbol of the unconquerable spirit of free men and women faced with terrible odds. Even
                                with
                                victory won, Sir Winston chose not to stand on his already matchless record, but to
                                continue
                                to devote unstintingly his great talents of statesmanship to securing the peace.
                                Canadians
                                remember his immeasurable service in the cause of freedom in war and in peace, and they
                                send
                                affectionate greetings to Sir Winston Churchill on his birthday anniversary and wish him
                                strength for the burdens which still lie ahead.

                                Across the channel from Britain, there are many who remember and wish to add their

                                France. Her fields, even in this harvest time, 1954, still bearing the scars of the
                                storm,
                                her beaches gaunt for the skeletons of the liberation fleet. France will not forget.

                                Sir Winston Churchill reaches today his 80 years surrounded by his glory. From time to
                                time,
                                people announce that he's going to retire. I don't believe it. As I know, my illustrious
                                friend, his secret desire is to die standing, addressing the House of Commons. He's a
                                fighter. Before the war, we fought together to reveal the danger of war to our people
                                and to
                                urge our governments to prepare for war. During the war, we were companions in distress.
                                After my overthrow in Bordeaux in 1940 for refusing to ask an armistice, I always
                                believed
                                in victory. In all the prisons in which I was held during five years in France and in
                                Germany, I never doubted. And one of the reasons for my conviction was that Churchill
                                was
                                standing at the helm.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And in his own land, pictures of him in cottages that have been standing, one suspects,
                                since the days of the protector. The crowds who stand in the rain before Downing Street,
                                amply rewarded, they feel, by a glimpse of his black derby or his hand raised in the V
                                for
                                Victory symbol. The deference that is his even in the great halls of Windsor Castle.
                                This is
                                his reward. This and the words from those who love him.

                                From London, the British Foreign Secretary, the Right Honourable Sir Anthony Eden. What
                                I
                                think will strike you all about the tributes which are being paid today to Winston
                                Churchill
                                is their diversity and variety. This very fact is the measure of his grandeur and
                                quality.
                                There have been many men in our generation to whom the epithet great might be applied,
                                choose or accomplishment.

                                Knowledgeable language and his understanding of the colloquial. This grammarian took
                                exception to a sentence which ended with a preposition. Not wishing to make a major
                                issue of
                                it, he simply placed a red exclamation point next to the offending word. When the script
                                was
                                returned to Churchill, he got very angry. He refused to change a single word and uttered
                                the
                                classic reply, such arrant pedantry I cannot up with put.

                                But perhaps his humor, like his prose, reached a new height during the war. It was Sir
                                Winston himself who spread the story of an audience given by the King and himself to an
                                American banker at a time when the outlook was blackest for England. London is being
                                raided
                                nightly, the King is supposed to have said. Ramo may capture Suez. India's infirmament.
                                Japan menaces Australia. What to do? What to do? The American considered gravely,
                                according
                                to Sir Winston, and then suggested, Your Majesty, if I were you, I'd put Canada in the
                                Queen's name.
                            </p>

                                America and Britain. The old world and the new. We got to know each other pretty well in
                                those years when Britain played host to the young men and women with the US on the
                                collars
                                of their uniforms, but not quite well enough. It's a meaningful American woman to write
                                the
                                lines that will, I think, forever interpret Britain to America and America to Britain.
                                Miss
                                Alice Dewar Miller gave us the storyof an American girl who marries an Englishman and,
                                Robert, listen. Miss Lynn Fontaine in a reading from The White Cliffs of Dover. Later
                                than
                                many, earlier than some, I knew the die was cast, that war must come, that war must
                                come.
                                Night after night I lay, stealing a broken heart to face the day when he, my son, would
                                tread the very same path that his father trod. When the day came, I was not sealed, not
                                ready. Foolish wild words issued from my lips. My child, my child, why should you die
                                for
                                England too? He smiled. Is she not worth it if I must, he said. John would have answered
                                yes, but John was dead. Is she worth dying for? My love, my one and only love, had died
                                and
                                now his son asks me, his alien mother, to assay the worth of England to mankind today.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I thought of my father's deep traditional wrath against England, the redcoat bully, the
                                ancient foe, that second reaping of hate, that aftermath of a ruler's folly and
                                ignorance
                                long ago, long, long ago. Yet who can honestly say England is utterly changed? Not I,
                                not I.
                                Arrogance, ignorance, folly are here today. And for these my son must die? I thought of
                                these years, these last dark terrible years, when the rulers of England bade the English
                                believe lies as the price of peace, lies and fears, lies that corrupt and fears that sap
                                and
                                deceive. Rulers of England, for them must I send out my only son to die?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And then and then I thought of the history of Englishmen, of Queen Elizabeth stepping
                                down
                                over the stones of Plymouth Town to greet the man who had sailed away from rocky inlet
                                and
                                wooded bay. Free men, undisciplined, uncontrolled, some of them pirates, all of them
                                bold,
                                feeling their fate was England's fate, coming to save it a little late, much too late
                                for
                                the easy way, much too late, and yet never quite too late to win in that last worst
                                fight.
                                Men who have governed England know that dreadful line that they may not pass. Even
                                Elizabeth
                                long ago, honored and loved and bold as brass, daring and subtle, arrogant, clever, yet
                                even
                                the great Elizabeth never dared oppose the sullen might of the English standing upon a
                                right.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And were they not English, our forefathers? Never more English than when they shook the
                                dust
                                of her sod from their feet forever, angrily seeking ashore where in his own way a man
                                might
                                worship his God. Never more English than when they dared be rebels against her, that
                                stern,
                                intractable sense of that which no man can stomach and still be free, writing when in
                                the
                                course of human events, writing it out so all the world could see whence come the powers
                                of
                                all just governments. The tree of liberty grew and changed and spread, but the seed was
                                English.

                                I am American bred. I have seen much to hate here, much to forgive. But in a world where
                                England is finished and dead, I do not wish to live.

                                Probably no one machine has contributed as much to our abundance of food and fiber as
                                the
                                farm tractor. One of agriculture's great steps forward came when Alice Chalmers
                                introduced
                                the rubber-tired tractor. Another came with the adaptation of tractors, combine
                                harvesters,
                                and other power equipment to the family-sized farm. Introduced more recently by Alice
                                Chalmers was a machine called the rotobailer, which makes weather-resistant round bales.
                                And
                                now there's a forage harvester which brings pasture to the cattle in the feedlot,
                                cutting
                                the cost of producing milk and beef.

                                Today, Alice Chalmers tractors and equipment with many new conveniences and advantages
                                can
                                be bought for fewer bushels of wheat or corn or fewer pounds of cotton or livestock
                                thanprevious to World War II. A sound and prosperous agriculture is essential to a
                                healthy
                                economy. And Alice Chalmers continues to pioneer in building power farm equipment which
                                brings better living, better farming, and more profit to the family farm.

                                voice,
                                there needs must fall a shadow across the room. For the time will come when we will
                                never
                                again hear a new speech from this man or turn a fresh page in the writings that seem to
                                flow
                                like some inexhaustible stream from his study.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You who would write, listen first to this. Writing a book is an adventure. To begin
                                with, it
                                is a toy and an amusement. Then it becomes a mistress. And then it becomes a master. And
                                then it becomes a tyrant. And the last phase is that just as you are about to be
                                reconciled
                                to your servitude, you kill the monster and bring him about to the public.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The more we preserve our language, see it is not unduly damaged by modern slang
                                adaptations
                                and intruders. I was shocked the other day to hear the Chancellor of the Exchequer use
                                the
                                word quantify. Have you ever heard that before? I hope you will never hear it again.
                                Quantify. I believe it was a substitute for estimate. Well, let us be careful of that.
                                Another odious expression is very common use, which is to say in short supply. So why
                                can't
                                you say scarce? Broadly speaking, the short words are the best. And the old words, when
                                short, are the best of all.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Somebody said that the only events that pass into history are those which some men wrote
                                memorably about. Well, certainly there are people who never heard of Texas, if you can
                                imagine anyone so benighted, who have heard of the Alamo. Because one man who knew a
                                little
                                Greek once said about it, Thermopylae had its messengers of defeat. The Alamo had none.

                                This is Mr. Alistair Cook of the Manchester Guardian, long an observer of the American
                                scene
                                and a very special student of what I suppose will be called the Churchillian language.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Mr. Cook. We are honoring tonight the most many-sided man since Leonardo da Vinci. And
                                it's
                                my privilege to talk to you for a couple of minutes about the side of him that
                                guarantees
                                immortality to all the others. The lucky fact that he writes better than all
                                contemporary
                                men of events, and so has become already his own best historian. Anybody who has ever
                                read a
                                page of Churchill or heard him talk is aware of being in the presence of a man who
                                enjoys
                                the big gesture and the grand adjective. So do all politicians. But they go to the same
                                tawdry costume house to clothetheir thoughts, whereas, as a ghostwriter once reminded a
                                despairing president, Churchill rolls his own. In one speech he could describe the war
                                to
                                the House of Commons as a stand against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark,
                                lamentable catalogue of human crime. And a month later he simply told the same audience,
                                get
                                used to the bombings, eels get used to skinning.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some will always remember his language in full regalia, and some will prefer his rapier
                                in
                                the House. At four o'clock this morning Hitler invaded Russia. All his usual formalities
                                of
                                perfidy were scrupulously observed. He is unique in being able to handle the ordinary
                                English sentence with equal mastery as a diamond-encrusted sword, a big stick, or a pea
                                shooter. But he could have all this and still be merely the most eloquent politician of
                                our
                                time.

                            <p>
                                What will make him unforgettable, I think, is the miraculous coincidence that he was the
                                best historian of tremendous events in which he was also the chief actor. It is as if
                                Gibbon
                                had been also the most eminent of the Roman emperors. Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill,
                                a
                                name to conjure with, a giant who walks among us, a voice to interpret what has gone
                                before
                                and to give new meaning to the ancient words courage and honor and dignity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is usual for gentlemen who reach an advanced age to be asked to give a piece of
                                advice
                                for those who will come after. Sir Winston has performed this duty as he has all the
                                others.
                                Listen, out of the wisdom of the past, a signpost to the future:





                                If the human race wishes to have a prolonged and indefinite period of material
                                prosperity,
                                they've only got to behave in a peaceful and helpful way towards one another.

                            </p>
                            <p>

                                And science will do for them all that they wish and more than they can dream.

                            </p>
                            <p>

                                Nothing is final. Change is unceasing.
                            </p>
                            <p>


                                And it is very likely that mankind has a lot more to learn before they come to their
                                journey's end.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We might even find ourselves in a few years moving along a broad, smooth causeway of
                                peace
                                and plenty instead of roaming and peering round along the rim of hell. Thus we may, by
                                patience, courage, and in orderly progression, reach someday, with God's blessing, the
                                shelter of a calmer and kindlier age.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill. Hold his words against the years. His like will not
                                again
                                pass this way in our lifetime, nor yet in the allotted time of our children. How shall
                                we
                                take the measure of this man? Of all the words that have spilled from his pen, there is
                                one
                                short passage that perhaps above all else shows us the workings of his mind and heart.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We have heard these words before. They were spoken not in victory, but in defeat. They
                                were
                                spoken not in the confidence of youth, but in the twilight of age. He had just been
                                defeated
                                for re-election at the end of the war. A few supporters came to his home that night to
                                give
                                condolences. He spoke briefly to them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And let it be known to all of us around the world. I am, as I am reminded, an old man.
                                It is
                                true that all the daydreams of my youth have been accomplished. I have no personal
                                advantage
                                to gain by undertaking once more the hard and grim duty of leading Britain and our
                                Empire.
                                But whileGod gives me the strength and the people show me their goodwill, it is my duty
                                to
                                try. And try I will. It is my duty to try, and try I will. This is my duty to try, and
                                try I
                                will. </p>
