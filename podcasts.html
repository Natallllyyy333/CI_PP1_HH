                                Born in Corsica in 1769, Napoleon quickly advanced through military ranks during the
                                French Revolution. By 1799, he seized power in a coup, declaring himself First
                                Consul.
                                In 1804, he crowned himself Emperor, consolidating absolute authority..

                            <h4>The Height of Empire</h4>

                            <p>
                                Napoleonâ€™s military genius expanded French dominance across Europe. Victories at
                                Austerlitz and Jena made him feared, while legal reforms like the Napoleonic Code
                                modernized governance. However, constant wars drained France and provoked
                                resistance.
                            </p>
                            <h4>The Downfall</h4>
                            <p>
                                The disastrous 1812 invasion of Russia marked the beginning of the end. Defeated by
                                a
                                coalition of European powers, Napoleon was forced to abdicate in 1814 and was exiled
                                to
                                Elba. He escaped in 1815, briefly reclaiming power during the "Hundred Days," but
                                his
                                final defeat at Waterloo sealed his fate.</p>
                            <h4>Final Exile</h4>
                            <p>
                                The British exiled Napoleon to the remote island of Saint Helena in the South
                                Atlantic.
                                There, he lived in isolation until his death in 1821. Despite his fall, Napoleonâ€™s
                                legacy endures in law, military strategy, and the reshaping of Europe.</p>

                            <p> From emperor to exile, his life remains a testament to ambitionâ€™s triumphs and
                                perils.</p>

                            Winston Churchill (1874â€“1965) was a British statesman, orator, and writer who led the United
                            Kingdom through its darkest hour during World War II. Known for his unwavering resolve and
                            stirring speeches, Churchill became a symbol of resistance against Nazi tyranny.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Born into an aristocratic family, Churchill had a varied career as a soldier, journalist,
                            and politician before becoming Prime Minister in 1940. His leadership during the war,
                            particularly during the Battle of Britain, inspired the nation with famous speeches like "We
                            shall fight on the beaches" and "Their finest hour."</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Despite losing the 1945 election after the war, Churchill remained influential, warning of
                            the Cold Warâ€™s dangers and promoting European unity. A prolific writer, he won the Nobel
                            Prize in Literature in 1953 for his historical works.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p> Remembered as one of historyâ€™s greatest leaders, Churchillâ€™s legacy endures as a testament
                            to courage, determination, and the power of words in times of crisis.

                            "Good evening. My name is Herbert Marshall. I am, as some of you will know, an actor. A
                            player of parts, a meddler, if you will, in other people's dreams. Upon request, those of my
                            craft can summon up a tragedy or a comedy, weep over ancient wrongs, make fantasy real and
                            reality a thing as formidable as the mists that roll in come midnight over the coast of
                            Britain.</p>
                        <p>

                            But tonight I come on a different errand. The dreams I meddle with are my own and yours. For
                            herewith is the story of a man who yet walks among us, whose words you have heard, whose
                            decisions for better or for worse have molded our lives and the ways of generations yet
                            unborn. Next Tuesday, he will be 80 years old.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But listen. I am, as I am reminded, an old man. It is true that all that ailed me in my
                            youth have been accomplished. I have no personal advantage to gain by undertaking once more
                            the hard and grim duty of leading Britain and our empire. But while God gives me the
                            strength and the people show me their goodwill, it is my duty to try. And try I will.
                            Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill. Still for him the tumult and the shouting, the captain to
                            the king.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But for us on this birthday eve, time for a looking back. Time to walk again the paths we
                            walked together in less quiet days. Here, in Sir Winston's own incomparable words, is the
                            story of our times. The pride and the shame, the glory and the pain of it. The tumult and
                            the shouting.

                            Alice Chalmers Manufacturing Company and in Canada, Alice Chalmers Rumley Limited and
                            Canadian Alice Chalmers Limited present The Tumult and the Shouting, an autobiography of Sir
                            Winston Churchill titled His Finest Hour, a program specially prepared in honor of his 80th
                            birthday next Tuesday. This is Ben Brower speaking. In the next 55 minutes or so, we shall
                            bring back the voice of Sir Winston Churchill, a voice caught in its most dramatic moments
                            and held against the years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We shall hear the French Premier when alien boots tramped the streets of Paris. We shall
                            hear Salon to Olivier, Sir Ralph Richardson, Lynn Fontaine and a host of ladies and
                            gentlemen who, each in his own fashion, wishes to say happy birthday.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You know, this is an era of spectacular progress, particularly in bringing the good things
                            of life to more and more people. Three important economic measurements of how well we live
                            are these:





                            The abundance of food and fiber we produce.



                            Our production and use of electrical energy.



                            A construction program to match our growing population.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Alice Chalmers seeks to contribute to better living by building key machines necessary for
                            progress in each of these three fields. Consider the need for more construction. Population
                            totals in the United States and Canada are increasing by more than 50,000 every week, almost
                            the equivalent of two new cities the size of Philadelphia and Ottawa every year. To house
                            these new citizens, our two countries are building new homes at a rate of more than a
                            million yearly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Consider also that new motor vehicles are going into use at more than double the rate of
                            street and highway construction. That is why each of our countries is giving increased
                            attention to road improvement, with a new $100 billion program under study in the United
                            States.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Alice Chalmers builds many of the key machines necessary to such progress: crawler tractors,
                            motor scrapers, motor graders, and engines for earth moving, logging, mining, and pipe
                            laying. Crushers, screens, cement plants, and equipment to help mines and quarries turn
                            outthe raw materials of construction. Yes, construction is one of the measuring sticks of
                            progress toward better living, and it is the gratifying work of Alice Chalmers to build
                            machines which contribute to this progress.

                            And now, here to guide us on our story of Sir Winston Churchill, is one of the most
                            distinguished gentlemen of the American and British theater, Mr. Herbert Marshall.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            How do you take the measure of a man? We have learned to gauge a mountain's height, to trace
                            the contours of the ocean floor. We can triangulate the miles that stretch from here to the
                            nearest star. But man, this most multitudinous and familiar of creatures, here is mystery.
                            Young Churchill must have been a mystery to one of his schoolmasters, for example, who
                            remembered him only as a somewhat reluctant student who had difficulty pronouncing the
                            letter S. He was born in a rambling old castle, nourished in plenty, molded by traditions
                            older even than his name. In short, had every opportunity to develop into a typical landed
                            English gentleman, respected and honored by his family, and totally unknown beyond the
                            narrow parish wherein he conducted his affairs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But fame is a jealous mistress, and whoso would win her favors knows many a rocky road and
                            many a sleepless night. There was war in India, and he had learned the color of blood at a
                            time when most of his fellow students at Sandhurst were still wrestling with the book of
                            regulations. There was a bigger war in France in which he took a bigger part, first Lord of
                            the Admiralty, then the first of many setbacks, demoted and again a frontline officer. But
                            even then, those who listened knew that a very special man had come among them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Let me ask you this. What subtle, almost mystic pattern defied thousands of miles across
                            South Africa? All the world listens. Bludgeon great races, the Czechs, the Poles, the
                            Norwegians, the Danes, the Dutch, the Belgians, upon all of whom the long night of barbarism
                            will descend, unbroken even by a star of hope, unless we conquer, and conquer we must, as
                            conquer we shall.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prime Minister Winston Churchill, called back in his hour of trial, and the story that was
                            over has just begun. Winston Churchill, this man with a face like Mr. Pickwick and a voice
                            like a swashbuckling Elizabethan. Winston Churchill, a name to conjure with, a man to stand
                            against the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune and throw his defiance against the
                            storm.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The night he became Prime Minister, May the 10th, it was, 1940, a British destroyer slipped
                            out of the harbor at Southampton for patrol duty along the channel. Another ship was coming
                            in. In a matter of seconds, the signal was flashed from the first ship to the second, Winnie
                            is back. And across the dark waters of the bay, there came the echo of cheering as the
                            message was passed from mouth to mouth, Winnie is back.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Tell it to the young mother struggling to fit a gas mask on her youngest and uncomprehending
                            son. Tell it to the soldiers poised across the channel to give aid to the retreating French.
                            The English channel, since time out of mind, a moat of this fortress island, a road to less
                            happier lands, a wall that divides Britain from the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The sea is calm tonight, the tide is full, the moonlight fair upon the straits. On the
                            French coast, the light gleams and is gone. The cliffs of England stand glimmering and vast
                            out in the tranquil bay. Come to the window, sweet is the night air. Only from the long line
                            of spray where the sea meets the moon-blanched land, listen, you hear the grating roar of
                            pebbles which the waves draw back and fling at their return of the highest land, begin and
                            cease and then again begin with tremulous cadence slow and bring the eternal note of sadness
                            in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sophocles long ago heard it on the Aegean and it brought intohis mind the turbid ebb and
                            flow of human misery. We find also in the sound a thought, hearing it by this distant
                            northern sea. The Sea of Faith was once too at the full, and round Earth's shore lay like
                            the folds of a bright girdle fur. But now I only hear its melancholy long withdrawing roar,
                            retreating to the breath of a night wind down the vast edges drear and naked shingles of the
                            world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our love, let us be true to one another. For the world which seems to lie before us like a
                            land of dreams, so various, so beautiful, so new, has really neither joy nor love nor light,
                            nor certitude nor peace, nor help nor pain. And we are here as on a darkling plain, swept
                            with confused alarms of struggle and flight, where ignorant armies clash by night.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They managed to sing, some of them, God knows how, of their retreat. Long lines crowding
                            down on the beach at Dunkirk, whole regiments missing, half their equipment lining the road
                            that stretched back to the channel. The enemy had been too strong, too fast. That they came
                            from the battle not in disorder as frightened men come, but in weariness and thickened heart
                            of men who had been asked to do too much.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dunkirk. A small French town perched on the rim of the waves that gave it birth. Stand where
                            you are, you with the weariness in your eyes. Rest a moment, you too young to learn what you
                            have learned these last few days. Look to the sea. Over the rim of the horizon a miracle is
                            in the making. A hastily assembled fleet, fishing craft most of them, occasional are the
                            trim lines of a pleasure craft, an icebox fashioned for champagne now holding plasma. And so
                            they came back.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Berlin, Hitler smiled and clapped his hands like a child. Britain, that most formidable
                            of enemies, had been engaged and beaten. Beaten? Not quite. It's June the 19th, 1940. The
                            hospitals are crowded with men who returned. Even as we speak, the Luftwaffe is gathering
                            for the first blow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But now, Mr. Prime Minister, I do not at all underrate the severity of the ordeal which lies
                            before us. For all of us, whatever our sphere or station, it will be a help to think of the
                            famous lines:





                            In nothing common did or mean upon that memorable scene.

                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Aye, more, freedom shall be restored to all.



                            We abate nothing of our dust demands.



                            Not one jot or tittle do we receive.



                            The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us.



                            Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this island or lose the war.



                            If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be freed and the life of the world may move
                            forward into broad, sunlit uplands.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties. So bear ourselves that if the British Empire
                            and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, this was their finest
                            hour. And in this hour, Britain stood alone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each night was a repetition of the last. Each dawn saw the enemy hasten away like some evil
                            creature who walks only at night. Fire licking at the majestic dome of St. Paul's, bombs
                            falling on the slums of Whitechapel and Spitalfields as though to compound the misery
                            already there. Bombs in the palace yard and a king who stands unmoved at the crash of glass
                            or the splintering of wood.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These sounds would echo across the world, would be heard of the huge rambling old house that
                            sits back from the street at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington,D.C. No matter how many
                            doors were closed against it, the sound came through. You could hear it in Dubuque. You
                            could hear it in Dubuque. Cleveland and Medicine Hat. Bombs and the sound of marching feet.
                            They rang down every street. The echo beat against your door.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            President Lincoln said in 1862,



                            Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this administration will
                            be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance or insignificance can spare
                            one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us in honor or
                            dishonor to the latest generation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And so what Mr. Churchill was to call the Grand Alliance began to take form. June 22nd,
                            1941, and a world grown familiar with the unbelievable heard a piece of news that strained
                            all credulity. In the early hours of the morning, Adolf Hitler had invaded Russia. Like
                            Napoleon before him, he sent his legions swarming into the plains that stretch out beyond
                            the Neiman River. Like Napoleon, he spoke contemptuously of the Russian winter, the long
                            nights, the wind that sweeps down out of Siberia like the stab of a sword.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once again in Downing Street, time for decision. At four o'clock this morning, Hitler
                            attacked and invaded Russia. No one has been a more consistent opponent of communism than I
                            have for the last 25 years. I will unsay no word that I've spoken about it. But all this
                            fades away before the spectacle which is now unfolding. The past with its crimes, its
                            follies, and its tragedies flashes away. Any man or state who fights against Nazism will
                            have our aid. Any man or state who marches with Hitler is our foe. That is our policy and
                            that is our declaration. It follows, therefore, that we shall give whatever help we can to
                            Russia and to the Russian people.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is not given to the living to see the future. Hitler could not divine the Battle of
                            Stalingrad, nor could the powers of the West foresee with clarity the twisting tortured way
                            that lay out of Stalingrad. But to the West, a star of hope for all free men.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Two months after the invasion of Russia, a British ship of war anchored somewhere off the
                            coast of Newfoundland. The sun turned the wind-lashed sea into a carpet of sparkling jewels.
                            President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill met on the huge quarterdeck and talked like
                            the old friends they were. And from their talks was forged the Atlantic Charter, a map for
                            the path to freedom, a compact for the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sunday morning found them with their work done. And in the manner of their fathers, they
                            found time to give thanks that Sunday morning. Roosevelt sitting there in that old cape he
                            loved so well. The Prime Minister next to him smiling as they and the crew joined in singing
                            Onward Christian Soldiers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We had a church parade on the Sunday in our Atlantic Bay. The President came onto the
                            quarterdeck of the Prince of Wales where there were mingled together many hundreds of
                            American and British sailors and marines. The sun shone bright and warm while we all sang
                            the old hymns which are our common inheritance and which we learned as children in our
                            homes. When I looked upon that densely packed congregation, it swept across me that here ran
                            the only hope, but also the sure hope of saving the world from measureless degradation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And so we came back across the ocean wave,uplifted in spirit, fortified in resolve. And then
                            I felt that hard and terrible and long drawn out as this struggle may be. We shall not be
                            denied the strength to do our duty to the end.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And so the bones were forged, ties the more subtle for being unseen, a friendship stronger
                            because of the test that must admit. Capitol Hill in Washington, Congress in convention
                            assembled stands in tribute to the man who walks slowly to the speaker's stand. Senate,
                            House of Representatives, these are not part of the vocabulary of government as he has
                            learned it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But this man is no stranger to any assembly where English is the language spoken. I cannot
                            help but reflecting that if my father had been American and my mother British instead of the
                            other way around, I might have got here on my own. In that case, this would not have been
                            the first time you would have heard my voice. In that case, I should not have needed any
                            invitation. But if I had, it is hardly likely that it would have been unanimous. So perhaps
                            things are better as they are.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One final word before he returns to his bomb-wrecked homeland. It is December the 24th,
                            1941, that most somber Christmas Eve. A tree has been lighted on the White House lawn, an
                            act of defiance almost on that day. A desperate attempt at make-believe, a way of telling
                            yourself and your neighbor that this Christmas will be just like all other Christmases when
                            we all knew it would not.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The president has spoken to the group who came down to watch the ceremony. And now, would
                            the Prime Minister say a few words?

                            Fellows, soldiers, in the cause, this is a strange Christmas Eve. Almost the whole world is
                            locked in deadly struggle, armed with the most terrible weapons which science can devise.
                            The nations advance upon each other. Ill would it be for us this Christmastide if we were
                            not sure that no greed for the lands of wealth of any other people, no vulgar ambition, no
                            morbid lust for material gain at the expense of others, had led us to the field. Ill would
                            it be for us if that were so.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here in the midst of war raging and roaring over all the lands and seas, creeping nearer to
                            our hearts and homes. Here amid all these tumult, we have tonight the peace of the spirit in
                            each cottage home and in every generous heart. Therefore, we may cast aside, for this night
                            at least, the cares and dangers which beset us and make for the children an evening of
                            happiness in a world of storms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here then, for one night only, each home throughout the English-speaking world should be a
                            brightly lighted island of happiness and peace. Let the children have their night of fun and
                            laughter. Let the gift of Father Christmas delight their play. Let us grown-ups share to the
                            full in their unstinted pleasures before we turn again to the stern task and formidableyear
                            that lie before us. Resolved that by our sacrifice and daring, these same children shall not
                            be robbed of their inheritance or denied their right to live in a free and decent world. And
                            so, in God's mercy, a happy Christmas to you all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We are midway in our 80th birthday tribute to Sir Winston Churchill. We continue after a
                            brief pause for station identification. Again, here is Herbert Marshall.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the fullness of time, the final scene was played. It came suddenly, it seemed, to many of
                            us. All at once there were Allied soldiers at the gates of Berlin, Hitler dead by his own
                            hand. The German divisions that once seemed invincible were fleeing down roads that just
                            four years before they had marched in arrogance and victory. Traffic was stopped in
                            Trafalgar Square. It was the same in Times Square, in Melbourne, Toronto, in Atlanta and
                            Oslo, and as before, this voice above all others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The German war is therefore at an end. We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing.
                            But let us not forget for a moment the toils and efforts that lie ahead.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Advance Britannia! Long live the cause of freedom!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This royal throne of kings, this sceptered isle, this earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
                            this other Eden, demi-paradise, this fortress built by nature for herself against infection
                            and the hand of war, this happy breed of men, this little world, this precious stone set in
                            the silver sea, which served it in the office of a wall or as a moat defensive to a house
                            against the envy of less happier lands, this blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this
                            kingdom.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And so we are come to wish a happy birthday to the Prime Minister. We who owe him much offer
                            what words we can as a part payment, if you will, for services rendered. In so doing, we
                            take our place among a distinguished company.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We are pleased to present the Canadian Prime Minister, the Honourable Louis San Laurent.
                            Canada is delighted to join in the birthday salute to Sir Winston Churchill and I am greatly
                            honoured to have been asked to be the spokesman for my 15 million fellow Canadians. In this
                            country we recall with heartfelt admiration and gratitude the peerless leadership he gave to
                            us all in the grim days of the war when the Commonwealth unaided was fighting the forces of
                            evil. Sir Winston in those days had become far more than the Prime Ministerof any one
                            country. For all of us, his voice was the voice of human freedom, and he represented the
                            symbol of the unconquerable spirit of free men and women faced with terrible odds. Even with
                            victory won, Sir Winston chose not to stand on his already matchless record, but to continue
                            to devote unstintingly his great talents of statesmanship to securing the peace. Canadians
                            remember his immeasurable service in the cause of freedom in war and in peace, and they send
                            affectionate greetings to Sir Winston Churchill on his birthday anniversary and wish him
                            strength for the burdens which still lie ahead.

                            Across the channel from Britain, there are many who remember and wish to add their voice.
                            France. Her fields, even in this harvest time, 1954, still bearing the scars of the storm,
                            her beaches gaunt for the skeletons of the liberation fleet. France will not forget. Ladies
                            and gentlemen, the wartime premier of France, Monsieur Paul Reynaud.

                            Sir Winston Churchill reaches today his 80 years surrounded by his glory. From time to time,
                            people announce that he's going to retire. I don't believe it. As I know, my illustrious
                            friend, his secret desire is to die standing, addressing the House of Commons. He's a
                            fighter. Before the war, we fought together to reveal the danger of war to our people and to
                            urge our governments to prepare for war. During the war, we were companions in distress.
                            After my overthrow in Bordeaux in 1940 for refusing to ask an armistice, I always believed
                            in victory. In all the prisons in which I was held during five years in France and in
                            Germany, I never doubted. And one of the reasons for my conviction was that Churchill was
                            standing at the helm.
                        </p>

                            And in his own land, pictures of him in cottages that have been standing, one suspects,
                            since the days of the protector. The crowds who stand in the rain before Downing Street,
                            amply rewarded, they feel, by a glimpse of his black derby or his hand raised in the V for
                            Victory symbol. The deference that is his even in the great halls of Windsor Castle. This is
                            his reward. This and the words from those who love him.

                            From London, the British Foreign Secretary, the Right Honourable Sir Anthony Eden. What I
                            think will strike you all about the tributes which are being paid today to Winston Churchill
                            is their diversity and variety. This very fact is the measure of his grandeur and quality.
                            There have been many men in our generation to whom the epithet great might be applied,
                            choose or accomplishment.

                        <p>
                            Knowledgeable language and his understanding of the colloquial. This grammarian took
                            exception to a sentence which ended with a preposition. Not wishing to make a major issue of
                            it, he simply placed a red exclamation point next to the offending word. When the script was
                            returned to Churchill, he got very angry. He refused to change a single word and uttered the
                            classic reply, such arrant pedantry I cannot up with put.

                            But perhaps his humor, like his prose, reached a new height during the war. It was Sir
                            Winston himself who spread the story of an audience given by the King and himself to an
                            American banker at a time when the outlook was blackest for England. London is being raided
                            nightly, the King is supposed to have said. Ramo may capture Suez. India's infirmament.
                            Japan menaces Australia. What to do? What to do? The American considered gravely, according
                            to Sir Winston, and then suggested, Your Majesty, if I were you, I'd put Canada in the
                            Queen's name.

                            America and Britain. The old world and the new. We got to know each other pretty well in
                            those years when Britain played host to the young men and women with the US on the collars
                            of their uniforms, but not quite well enough. It's a meaningful American woman to write the
                            lines that will, I think, forever interpret Britain to America and America to Britain. Miss
                            Alice Dewar Miller gave us the storyof an American girl who marries an Englishman and,
                            Robert, listen. Miss Lynn Fontaine in a reading from The White Cliffs of Dover. Later than
                            many, earlier than some, I knew the die was cast, that war must come, that war must come.
                            Night after night I lay, stealing a broken heart to face the day when he, my son, would
                            tread the very same path that his father trod. When the day came, I was not sealed, not
                            ready. Foolish wild words issued from my lips. My child, my child, why should you die for
                            England too? He smiled. Is she not worth it if I must, he said. John would have answered
                            yes, but John was dead. Is she worth dying for? My love, my one and only love, had died and
                            now his son asks me, his alien mother, to assay the worth of England to mankind today.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I thought of my father's deep traditional wrath against England, the redcoat bully, the
                            ancient foe, that second reaping of hate, that aftermath of a ruler's folly and ignorance
                            long ago, long, long ago. Yet who can honestly say England is utterly changed? Not I, not I.
                            Arrogance, ignorance, folly are here today. And for these my son must die? I thought of
                            these years, these last dark terrible years, when the rulers of England bade the English
                            believe lies as the price of peace, lies and fears, lies that corrupt and fears that sap and
                            deceive. Rulers of England, for them must I send out my only son to die?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And then and then I thought of the history of Englishmen, of Queen Elizabeth stepping down
                            over the stones of Plymouth Town to greet the man who had sailed away from rocky inlet and
                            wooded bay. Free men, undisciplined, uncontrolled, some of them pirates, all of them bold,
                            feeling their fate was England's fate, coming to save it a little late, much too late for
                            the easy way, much too late, and yet never quite too late to win in that last worst fight.
                            Men who have governed England know that dreadful line that they may not pass. Even Elizabeth
                            long ago, honored and loved and bold as brass, daring and subtle, arrogant, clever, yet even
                            the great Elizabeth never dared oppose the sullen might of the English standing upon a
                            right.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And were they not English, our forefathers? Never more English than when they shook the dust
                            of her sod from their feet forever, angrily seeking ashore where in his own way a man might
                            worship his God. Never more English than when they dared be rebels against her, that stern,
                            intractable sense of that which no man can stomach and still be free, writing when in the
                            course of human events, writing it out so all the world could see whence come the powers of
                            all just governments. The tree of liberty grew and changed and spread, but the seed was
                            English.

                        <p>
                            I am American bred. I have seen much to hate here, much to forgive. But in a world where
                            England is finished and dead, I do not wish to live.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Friends, this has been Grower again.

                            Probably no one machine has contributed as much to our abundance of food and fiber as the
                            farm tractor. One of agriculture's great steps forward came when Alice Chalmers introduced
                            the rubber-tired tractor. Another came with the adaptation of tractors, combine harvesters,
                            and other power equipment to the family-sized farm. Introduced more recently by Alice
                            Chalmers was a machine called the rotobailer, which makes weather-resistant round bales. And
                            now there's a forage harvester which brings pasture to the cattle in the feedlot, cutting
                            the cost of producing milk and beef.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today, Alice Chalmers tractors and equipment with many new conveniences and advantages can
                            be bought for fewer bushels of wheat or corn or fewer pounds of cotton or livestock
                            thanprevious to World War II. A sound and prosperous agriculture is essential to a healthy
                            economy. And Alice Chalmers continues to pioneer in building power farm equipment which
                            brings better living, better farming, and more profit to the family farm.

                            Mr. Marshall? So we come almost to the present, Fulton, Missouri. President Truman and Prime
                            Minister Churchill sit on a small platform on the college grounds, both a little incongruous
                            in their academic robes. Mr. Churchill rises to speak. No one knows that within seconds a
                            new phrase is to be added to the English language. An iron curtain has descended across the
                            continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and
                            Eastern Europe:

                            It was the end of an era and the beginning of the new. But even as we listen to this voice,
                            there needs must fall a shadow across the room. For the time will come when we will never
                            again hear a new speech from this man or turn a fresh page in the writings that seem to flow
                            like some inexhaustible stream from his study.

                            You who would write, listen first to this. Writing a book is an adventure. To begin with, it
                            is a toy and an amusement. Then it becomes a mistress. And then it becomes a master. And
                            then it becomes a tyrant. And the last phase is that just as you are about to be reconciled
                            to your servitude, you kill the monster and bring him about to the public.

                            The more we preserve our language, see it is not unduly damaged by modern slang adaptations
                            and intruders. I was shocked the other day to hear the Chancellor of the Exchequer use the
                            word quantify. Have you ever heard that before? I hope you will never hear it again.
                            Quantify. I believe it was a substitute for estimate. Well, let us be careful of that.
                            Another odious expression is very common use, which is to say in short supply. So why can't
                            you say scarce? Broadly speaking, the short words are the best. And the old words, when
                            short, are the best of all.

                            Somebody said that the only events that pass into history are those which some men wrote
                            memorably about. Well, certainly there are people who never heard of Texas, if you can
                            imagine anyone so benighted, who have heard of the Alamo. Because one man who knew a little
                            Greek once said about it, Thermopylae had its messengers of defeat. The Alamo had none.

                            This is Mr. Alistair Cook of the Manchester Guardian, long an observer of the American scene
                            and a very special student of what I suppose will be called the Churchillian language.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mr. Cook. We are honoring tonight the most many-sided man since Leonardo da Vinci. And it's
                            my privilege to talk to you for a couple of minutes about the side of him that guarantees
                            immortality to all the others. The lucky fact that he writes better than all contemporary
                            men of events, and so has become already his own best historian. Anybody who has ever read a
                            page of Churchill or heard him talk is aware of being in the presence of a man who enjoys
                            the big gesture and the grand adjective. So do all politicians. But they go to the same
                            tawdry costume house to clothetheir thoughts, whereas, as a ghostwriter once reminded a
                            despairing president, Churchill rolls his own. In one speech he could describe the war to
                            the House of Commons as a stand against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark,
                            lamentable catalogue of human crime. And a month later he simply told the same audience, get
                            used to the bombings, eels get used to skinning.

                            Some will always remember his language in full regalia, and some will prefer his rapier in
                            the House. At four o'clock this morning Hitler invaded Russia. All his usual formalities of
                            perfidy were scrupulously observed. He is unique in being able to handle the ordinary
                            English sentence with equal mastery as a diamond-encrusted sword, a big stick, or a pea
                            shooter. But he could have all this and still be merely the most eloquent politician of our
                            time.

                            What will make him unforgettable, I think, is the miraculous coincidence that he was the
                            best historian of tremendous events in which he was also the chief actor. It is as if Gibbon
                            had been also the most eminent of the Roman emperors. Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill, a
                            name to conjure with, a giant who walks among us, a voice to interpret what has gone before
                            and to give new meaning to the ancient words courage and honor and dignity.

                            It is usual for gentlemen who reach an advanced age to be asked to give a piece of advice
                            for those who will come after. Sir Winston has performed this duty as he has all the others.
                            Listen, out of the wisdom of the past, a signpost to the future:





                            If the human race wishes to have a prolonged and indefinite period of material prosperity,
                            they've only got to behave in a peaceful and helpful way towards one another.

                        </p>
                        <p>

                            And science will do for them all that they wish and more than they can dream.

                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Nothing is final. Change is unceasing.
                        </p>
                        <p>


                            And it is very likely that mankind has a lot more to learn before they come to their
                            journey's end.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We might even find ourselves in a few years moving along a broad, smooth causeway of peace
                            and plenty instead of roaming and peering round along the rim of hell. Thus we may, by
                            patience, courage, and in orderly progression, reach someday, with God's blessing, the
                            shelter of a calmer and kindlier age.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill. Hold his words against the years. His like will not again
                            pass this way in our lifetime, nor yet in the allotted time of our children. How shall we
                            take the measure of this man? Of all the words that have spilled from his pen, there is one
                            short passage that perhaps above all else shows us the workings of his mind and heart.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We have heard these words before. They were spoken not in victory, but in defeat. They were
                            spoken not in the confidence of youth, but in the twilight of age. He had just been defeated
                            for re-election at the end of the war. A few supporters came to his home that night to give
                            condolences. He spoke briefly to them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And let it be known to all of us around the world. I am, as I am reminded, an old man. It is
                            true that all the daydreams of my youth have been accomplished. I have no personal advantage
                            to gain by undertaking once more the hard and grim duty of leading Britain and our Empire.
                            But whileGod gives me the strength and the people show me their goodwill, it is my duty to
                            try. And try I will. It is my duty to try, and try I will. This is my duty to try, and try I
                            will. </p>
                        <p>
